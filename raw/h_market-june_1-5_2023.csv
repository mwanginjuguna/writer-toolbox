In order to determine a patient's medical state, personal information must be gathered from them during a patient assessment, with an emphasis on their medical history, physical examination, and current illnesses.
An effective treatment depends on accurate patient data collected during an evaluation. In order to create a medical status that can accurately diagnose and treat health problems while utilizing medical jargon, clinicians must collect crucial pieces of patient history. Health information about a patient is fictitious data about their symptoms and interactions with doctors that is kept private and secret. The role of the physician in creating a health history for a 35-year-old Caucasian male with morbid obesity and impairments in a rural setting will be discussed in this study.
Communication and interview techniques for building a health history.
It's crucial to develop efficient communication in order to obtain an adequate health record. The patient in the conversation is a 35-year-old Caucasian male who lives in a rural region and has a history of morbid weight and handicap. Astute learning, the capacity to adapt to the patient's level of knowledge, empathy, the capacity to assess the patient's answers, the avoidance of medical jargon, and a leaning toward a particular religion or gender orientation are all qualities that the clinician must possess. To determine whether an interpretation is necessary, it is critical to understand the patient's kind and degree of disability as well as the type of communication modality that will be employed (Merker et al., 2021). Because each patient is different, everyone deserves a different evaluation. Social factors including age, gender, ethnicity, and environment all have an impact on how patients are interviewed in order to compile a thorough health history. To get accurate patient medical condition and information, building trust is crucial. It is crucial to establish effective contact with this patient in order to win his trust and accurately measure the effects of his health on both his health and his impairment as a result of the aforementioned causes.
Target your questions for building a health history.
The patient in the scenario is a person with morbid obesity and a disability, which helps to construct a medical status. The evaluation will be influenced by the type of disability, which will also determine the communication strategy to be utilized and whether a family member or interpreter has to be present throughout the interview. Instead of focusing just on lifestyle counseling and medical therapy, clinicians should focus on understanding the causes of a patient's health record, including social difficulties, and providing patient-centered care to effectively address a patient's condition (Shen et al., 2018). Depending on the patient's level of handicap, the targeted questions will be determined. The first step in compiling an accurate and thorough patient history and physical is efficient communication. For the best possible care, it is crucial to take a patient's socioeconomic determinants of health into account when conducting an interview. A patient who has a history of morbid obesity and impairment and lives in a remote area can ask: ""What obstacles do you have in getting the health care and treatment you need?"" The patient's orientation state must be ascertained by asking questions to obtain personal data such as date of birth, gender, and social position such as, ""Are you married?"" Who are your roommates? health insurance, physical environment, transportation, employment, and societal values are all factors. The establishing of a good connection between the therapist and the patient will be helped by these inquiries.
What kind of support would you receive from friends and family?
-How have you found your neighborhood?
What resources does your society have available?
What do you believe would make your life easier in terms of leading a healthier one?
What risk assessment instruments would be appropriate to use with each patient, or what questions would you ask each patient to assess his or her health risks?
Establishing the patient's trust and confidence is crucial when dealing with morbid obesity and handicap since it will help with communication, promote self-esteem, and give the patient the privacy he needs due to the psychological effects of obesity. paying great attention to the environmental and genetic factors that affect obesity. Obtaining information and facilitating assessments of his diet, interests, and behavioral changes, as well as inquiring about and comprehending his issues, are some helpful techniques. It is challenging to evaluate an obese patient due to the restrictions and changes in body composition from what is thought of as a normal weight. To determine his risk of heart disease, it is helpful to calculate his Body Mass Index (BMI) depending on his weight. When patients have enough data access and efficient diagnostic communications, they are best equipped to participate in their healthcare.
The instruments and questions listed below are general risk assessment tools that could be used with a variety of patients (Lloyd-Jones et al., 2019).
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) questionnaire asks about several health risks, including eating habits, physical activity level, and smoking behaviors.
The Heart Attack Risk Calculator from the American Heart Association (AHA) estimates a person's chance of suffering a heart attack during the following ten years.
Potential health-related risks based on the patient’s age, gender, ethnicity, or environmental setting.
Based on the patient's age, gender, ethnicity, and rural location, several health-related issues should be assessed. For instance, the patient's advanced age increases their vulnerability to illnesses including arthritis, heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease. The absence of medical care and/or the accessibility of emergency responders may also put the patient at a higher risk of suffering in a rural place (Ball et al., 2019).
In addition, the patient's gender and ethnicity may put them at a higher risk for developing illnesses. For instance, women are more likely than men to get arthritic, cardiovascular, and stroke conditions, while minorities are more likely to develop diabetes and high blood pressure.
Select one of the risk assessments instruments.
The patient in question is susceptible to a number of health issues, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. The patient would undoubtedly benefit from a health risk assessment by being informed of particular risk areas and how to reduce those risks. One such system of assessment is the Framingham Risk Score (Ball et al., 2019). Based on a person's age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol, and smoking history, this tool estimates their 10-year chance of developing heart disease. A specific preventative strategy might be created based on the patient's risk. The Reynolds Risk Score, which forecasts the likelihood of having a stroke, and the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III), which assesses the likelihood of developing heart disease, are other risk assessment tools that could be helpful for this patient.
Develop at least five targeted questions you would ask your selected patient to assess his or her health risks and begin building a health history.
Do you live by yourself?
The answer to this question helps the clinician understand the patient's living situation and the dangers he or she may face if unable to care for themselves.
How do you commute or transfer?
Justification: The physician will learn about the dangers of transferring patients as well as the constraints that come with being obese and disabled.
How do you meet your daily needs, first?
The purpose of this question is to determine whether the patient needs assistance and who in the patient's family or social network is a source of support.
Are you in possession of an advance directive?
Knowing who the patient has designated to make decisions for him when he is unable to do so due to his health issue or disability is the justification.
 Do you find it difficult to seek medical care?
Because of his size and disabilities, getting to a doctor's appointment may be challenging. The clinician will do an assessment to see if the patient needs help scheduling appointments and arranging transportation to get medical care.

    The patient profile I have been assigned is a 35-year-old white male with a history of morbid obesity with disabilities in a rural setting. This is a new patient whom I am assuming I have never met before. The first step is to build a relationship with the patient, this fosters trust between the nurse and patient. “A primary objective is to discover the details about a patient’s concern, explore expectations for the encounter, and display genuine interest, curiosity, and partnership. Identifying underlying worries, believing them, and trying to address them optimizes your ability to be of help” (Ball, J. W., et al. 2019). A thorough health history is important as it lays the groundwork to not only build a relationship, but to efficiently diagnose a health issue or illness, and treat these health issues and illnesses. 
    Communication with this age group needs to include non-medical jargon so the patient will understand the information presented. Medical jargon can be used but needs to be followed up with what the medical term means. Open ended communication is important to use, this gives the patient the ability to “fill in the blanks” with pertinent information. For example, asking the patient why they came to see you today, what health concerns they want to talk about, and keeping the conversation going by asking if there is anything else they would like to talk about. This can be added numerous times during the assessment to keep the patient talking about issues they may have. 
    Information needs to complete a health assessment can include, past medical history, family medical history, social history, present medications, lifestyle considerations like alcohol, drug use, and smoking history. A head-to-toe assessment also needs to be completed to determine if there are any other issues needed to address. This patient would need education regarding lifestyle changes needed related to obesity. A referral to a dietary consultant may be needed if the patient is ready to make changes to their diet. Patients who reside in rural areas have less access to nutritious foods due to distance needed to get to a store where they can buy these foods. Many rural areas have quick marts where people can get fast food, not necessarily nutritious foods. 
    Obesity can cause many other health risks including HTN, Diabetes, Joint issues, difficulty breathing, Sleep Apnea, skin issues like yeast infections, wounds, and Stroke. Obese patients can also have trouble with ADLs as the inability to care for themselves is common due to decreased energy and inability to complete personal cares. This patient is noted to have disabilities; this can be related to joint issues and inability to ambulate, bend, reach, and general muscular and joint problems. 
    In relation to a risk assessment, I would use preventative care including personal history, laboratory screening tests to rule out Diabetes, Prostate Cancer, Hypercholesterolemia, Infection, and a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel to determine if the patient had any blood related abnormalities and determine if the patient had any problems with kidney or liver function. I would also determine if the patient had any issues with Alcohol, Tobacco, or drug use as use of these can lead to disease. In my communication with the patient regarding these issues I would be sure to tell him I ask all my patients these questions. Sullivan, D.D. (2019) states, “Approaching these matters in a nonjudgmental, professional, matter of fact manner should enhance patient disclosure of sensitive information.”
    Questions I would be sure to include in my health assessment:
1.    How are you feeling today?
2.    What would you like for us to do today?
3.    What do you think is causing your symptoms?
4.    What are your coping mechanisms when you feel sad, scared, or angry?
5.    Do you have people in your life whom you can talk to?
I feel it is important to not only assess a patient’s physical well-being, but to also assess if they are happy with their lives and feel heard, happy, and involved in their own care.

REPLY2 M,"According to Rosenthal & Burchum, 2022, the reaction of drugs in the body is described in two teams known as pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Pharmacokinetics is defined as the movement of the drug through the body, or how the body affects the drug. And pharmacodynamics is how the drug affects the body, or how the drug initiates a therapeutic or toxic effect in the body. There have been several times when I have given a drug and I experienced the desired outcome was not met. For this discussion, I have chosen to center my discussion on was a 75-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia. She was started on a course of antibiotics, but she did not respond well to treatment. She continued to have fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The doctor ordered a blood test to check the patient's drug levels. The results showed that the patient's blood levels of the antibiotic were very low. This was because the patient's liver was not able to metabolize the drug as well as a younger person's liver, the doctor ordered a blood test to check the patient's drug levels. The results showed that the patient's blood levels of the antibiotic were very low. This was because the patient's liver was not able to metabolize the drug as well as a younger person's liver. I will explain basic pharmacokinetic processes, basic pharmacodynamics processes. Finally, I will explain personalized Plan of care.
Factors Influencing Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Processes:
Age:
The age of the patient plays a significant role in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. As individuals age, physiological changes occur, such as a decrease in liver and kidney function. In this case, the patient's liver function might have been compromised, leading to a decreased ability to metabolize the antibiotic. Older adults also tend to have a higher percentage of body fat and a lower percentage of lean body mass, which affects drug distribution and elimination.
Gender:
Gender differences can influence drug response due to variations in body composition and hormonal factors. Women generally have a lower body weight compared to men, which can affect drug distribution. Hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle can also influence drug metabolism and clearance. However, specific gender-related factors were not explicitly mentioned in the case.
Diet:
The patient's diet can impact drug absorption. For example, certain foods, like grapefruit juice, contain compounds that inhibit the activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes, leading to altered drug concentrations in the body. It is essential to assess the patient's dietary habits and provide guidance on potential drug-food interactions.
Pathophysiological Changes:
The patient's pneumonia might have influenced her liver and kidney function. Inflammation and infection can impair the liver's ability to metabolize drugs, resulting in altered drug levels. Similarly, kidney dysfunction can affect drug elimination, leading to increased drug concentrations in the body. It is crucial to consider the patient's underlying disease and its impact on drug metabolism and elimination (Balaram & Balachandran, 2022).
Personalized Plan of Care:
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring:
Regular monitoring of the patient's drug levels was crucial to ensure therapeutic efficacy and minimize adverse effects. In this case, the low blood levels of the initial antibiotic prompted a change in medication. Monitoring the blood levels of the new antibiotic will help determine if the dose is appropriate for the patient.
Dose Adjustment:
Considering the patient's age, gender, diet, and underlying disease, dosage adjustments may be necessary to optimize treatment outcomes. For example, a reduced dose might be warranted in older adults due to decreased drug metabolism and clearance. Individualized dosing regimens should be established to achieve optimal drug concentrations while minimizing the risk of toxicity (Isitan, & Hohler, 2017)
Patient Education:
Effective patient education is essential for medication adherence and safety. The patient should be educated about the importance of taking medications as prescribed, including the correct timing, dosage, and potential side effects. In this case, the patient should be informed about the need for regular blood tests and the rationale behind switching antibiotics.
Comprehensive Treatment of Underlying Health Conditions:
Collaborating with the patient's physician, a comprehensive plan should be developed to address the patient's pneumonia and any other underlying health conditions. This may involve additional therapies, such as respiratory treatments, chest physiotherapy, or supplemental oxygen, to improve the patient's overall health and response to treatment.( Parnham & Kricker, 2022).
Multidisciplinary Approach:
To ensure the best outcomes for the patient, a multidisciplinary approach involving healthcare professionals from various specialties, such as physicians, pharmacists, and nurses, should be employed. Collaboration between these professionals facilitates comprehensive patient assessment, individualized treatment plans, and ongoing monitoring of the patient's progress.
Conclusion:
In this discussion that feature a case of elderly with pneumonia who is taking antibiotics, several factors influenced the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes, including age, gender, diet, and pathophysiological changes due to pneumonia. A personalized plan of care was developed, which included therapeutic drug monitoring, dose adjustments, patient education, and a comprehensive approach to treat the underlying health condition. By considering these influencing factors and tailoring the plan of care accordingly, healthcare professionals can optimize treatment outcomes and ensure the safety and well-being of elderly patients.

Clinical Experience
Several years ago a flu shot clinic was being held for employees of the facility. It had been going on for several hours without any issues. If any issues did arise, the team would call for the non-patient rapid response team. In that case, the ER would respond. A RRT was called over head to the flu shot clinic. I responded and found a female patient lying on the floor in mild respiratory distress. She was anxious, diaphoretic, and stating like she felt like her throat was swelling, We quickly assessed her and did a set of vitals and felt it was safe to transport her to the ER down the hall. 
In the ER, the patient was placed on the cardiac monitor and vital signs were obtained. The provider ordered for an IV to be placed and medication given. Some of the meds first included Benadryl, Pepcid, and a steroid. IV fluids were started as well and the patient was placed on oxygen. After a short period, the patient symptoms had not improved. The provider ordered for epinephrine to be given. The patient was observed for some time after to make sure they did not rebound. 
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
Pharmacokinetics is the movement of drugs in the body. Pharmacodynamics is the affects of the drug on the body and mechanism of action ""Dose, indications, adverse effects, interactions... from PDR.net,"" n.d.). 
The influenza vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own antibodies against the virus. Several medications can interfere with the flu vaccine. In total, 268 medications can cause a severe reaction (""Influenza virus vaccine, inactivated interactions,"" n.d.).
A questionnaire should have been done prior to giving the vaccine. This is to make sure there has not been a previous reaction to the vaccine, eggs, or any ingredient to the vaccine. An anaphylaxis reaction would have to be caused by the virus or a component of the vaccine. 
Personalized Plan of Care
I'm not sure of the patient's prior health history before the event but I do know there was not a previous anaphylaxis event to a flu shot prior. The patient was being seen to rule out Lupus but no official diagnosis was given yet. As far as a plan, no further flu shots will be received. The patient should follow up with an allergist to see where the sensitivity lies. If any vaccine is approved, the patient should be pre-treated with Benadryl, Pepcid, and a Zyrtec prior to administration.

Do you believe that a program of HR metrics and workforce analytics might be useful in Regional Hospital?
What opportunities do you see regarding where and how metrics and analytics might be applied in this organization?
Identify three analyses and associated metrics you think might be useful for Regional Hospital to consider.

*Case Study: Regional Hospital
Regional Hospital is a 500-bed hospital and several associated clinics in a major East Coast metropolitan area. It has been an aggressive adopter of computing technologies in efforts to decrease costs and improve operational efficiencies. A critical challenge facing the hospital is meeting its ongoing challenges to staff the hospital and allied clinics effectively, given the ongoing shortage of nurses; uncertainty in health care legislation; emphasis on shortening hospital stays to reduce costs, which causes the daily census (numbers of patients in various departments) to vary dramatically from day to day and shift to shift; the continued aging of the population in its primary care area; and the unending competition for employees with key skill sets. Employee expenses represent more than 80% of the overall costs of operation for the hospital, so identifying ways to match optimal skills and numbers of employees to the appropriate shifts is critical to achieving consistent success. However, individual shift managers struggle to make effective staffing decisions, resulting in consistent overstaffing or understaffing of shifts and departments. These staffing problems potentially increase the high costs of varied levels of patient care and satisfaction and potentially increase the risk that staff turnover may escalate because of dissatisfaction with the continuing inability of managers to match staffing needs to demand.

Company managers recognize the potential that HR metrics and analytics might have for their organization, and they have come to you for help. They are hearing from their peers in other hospitals that metrics can help in this area but are not quite sure where to start. They are looking for you to offer guidance on how to do HR metrics and workforce analytics.",Human Resource Management,STRAYER,hr,

PREPARING A COLLABORATION PLAN,"Andrew is a 5-year-old boy in a full-day kindergarten program in Mrs. Brown’s classroom. During the first few weeks of school, Mrs. Brown notices that Andrew is struggling to adjust to the kindergarten day. In particular, he has difficulty following directions and making transitions from one activity to the next. However, other children are also having difficulty adjusting, so Mrs. Brown continues to observe Andrew. As the weeks follow and most of the class settles into the daily routine, Andrew’s difficulties seem to increase. Mrs. Brown’s observation notes identify concerns about Andrew’s behavior and development, including the following:

Early Literacy Skills:
    
Limited expressive vocabulary outside of his areas of interest, which include animals, and especially dogs
Limited sight-word vocabulary for kindergarten


Fine-Motor Skills:
    
Poor fine-motor skills, especially with cutting
Difficulties using a computer mouse
Poor eye-hand coordination (also noticed by the P.E. teacher)


Behavioral Concerns:
    
Frequent interruptions, for example, Andrew will ask unrelated questions and change topics during daily group times
Becomes frustrated when unsuccessful with both learning tasks and physical activities



Mrs. Brown also has the following anecdotal notes from her Fall parent-teacher conference with Andrew’s parents, both of whom attended the conference: “Andrew’s father, Mr. Unger, works full time. Since Andrew and his two younger siblings were born, his mother has stayed home to care for the children. Mrs. Unger’s native language is French. She appears to speak and understand English with little difficulty, although, she stated she is more comfortable with email and other written forms of communication. The family speaks both French and English at home. Mrs. Unger explained that Andrew’s experience with group programs before beginning kindergarten was mainly in family-based activities offered by the community, such as at the local library. She also noted that Andrew has always had a lot of energy, as do his siblings. Along with the family’s two dogs, she describes them as all ‘very lively’.”
Mrs. Brown draws on her experience to support and foster Andrew’s growth as best she can.

1. Debate This: Takeovers - Law Firm 6
Mario  Bonsetti and Rico Sanchez incorporated Gnarly Vulcan Gear, Inc. (GVG),  to manufacture windsurfing equipment. Bonsetti owned 60 percent of the  corporation’s stock, and Sanchez owned 40 percent. Both men served on  the board of directors. Hula Boards, Inc., owned solely by Mai Jin Li,  made a public offer to buy GVG stock. Hula offered 30 percent more than  the market price per share for the stock, and Bonsetti and Sanchez each  sold 20 percent of their stock to Hula. Jin Li became the third member  of the GVG board of directors. An irreconcilable dispute soon arose  between Bonsetti and Sanchez over design modifications of their popular  Baked Chameleon board. Despite Bonsetti’s dissent, Sanchez and Jin Li  voted to merge GVG with Hula Boards under the latter name, Gnarly Vulcan  Gear was dissolved, and production of the Baked Chameleon ceased. Using  the information presented in the chapter, answer the following  questions.

What rights does Bonsetti have (in most states) as a minority shareholder dissenting to the merger of GVG and Hula Boards?
Could the parties have used a short-form merger procedure in this situation? Why or why not?
What is the term used for Hula’s offer to purchase GVG stock?
Suppose  that after the merger, a person who was injured on the Baked Chameleon  board sued Hula (the surviving corporation). Can Hula be held liable for  the injury? Why or why not

2.     Debate This: Insider Trading - Law Firm 6
Dale  Emerson served as the chief financial officer for Reliant Electric  Company, a distributor of electricity serving portions of Montana and  North Dakota. Reliant was in the final stages of planning a takeover of  Dakota Gasworks, Inc., a natural gas distributor that operated solely  within North Dakota. On a weekend fishing trip with his uncle, Ernest  Wallace, Emerson mentioned that he had been putting in a lot of extra  hours at the office planning a takeover of Dakota Gasworks. When he  returned from the fishing trip, Wallace purchased $20,000 worth of  Reliant stock. Three weeks later, Reliant made a tender offer to Dakota  Gasworks stockholders and purchased 57 percent of Dakota Gasworks stock.  Over the next two weeks, the price of Reliant stock rose 72 percent  before leveling out. Wallace sold his Reliant stock for a gross profit  of $14,400. Using the information presented in the chapter, answer the  following questions.

Would registration with the SEC be required for Dakota Gasworks securities? Why or why not?
Did Emerson violate Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5? Why or why not?

POWER OF THE SITUATION
The motive to fit in often compels people to do what is considered appropriate behavior in a given situation. Sometimes the compulsion to fit in leads people to say or do something at odds with their sense of self. No one wants to be perceived as weird. Therefore, when the situation calls for a certain kind of behavior, people are likely to comply, even when that behavior is not consistent with their self-concept.
For this Discussion, you will examine conflict between a person’s behavior and sense of Be sure to review the Learning Resources before completing this activity.

You have been hired as a consultant for Pristine Urban-Tech Zither, Inc. (PUTZ), manufacturers of fine zithers (stringed instruments). The market for zithers is growing quickly. The company bought some land three years ago for $2.1 million in anticipation of using it as a toxic waste dump site but has recently hired another company to handle all toxic materials. Based on a recent appraisal, the company believes it could sell the land for $2.3 million on an after-tax basis. In four years, the land could be sold for $2.4 million after taxes. The company also hired a marketing firm to analyze the zither market, at a cost of $125,000. An excerpt of the marketing report is as follows:
The zither industry will have a rapid expansion in the next four years. With the brand name recognition that PUTZ brings to bear, we feel that the company will be able to sell 3,600, 4,300, 5,200, and 3,900 units each year for the next four years, respectively. Again, capitalizing on the name recognition of PUTZ, we feel that a premium price of $750 can be charged for each zither. Because zithers appear to be a fad, we feel at the end of the four-year period, sales should be discontinued. PUTZ believes that fixed costs for the project will be $415,000 per year, and variable costs are 15% of sales. The equipment necessary for production will cost $3.5 million and will be depreciated according to a three-year MACRS schedule. At the end of the project, the equipment can be scrapped for $350,000. Networking capital of $125,000 will be required immediately. PUTZ has a 38% tax rate, and the required rate of return on the project is 13%.

This discussion will help you develop the skills you need to synthesize several sources together.  Here's what you'll need to do: 
Step #1:  Read any three (3) of the five articles listed below on the movie CODA (2021). (You can find these articles at the links below. Pdf. copies are also attached at the end of the discussion prompt.)

Amanda Morris, New York Times Review: ""Representation or Stereotype? Deaf Viewers are torn over 'CODA.'""
Ann Hornaday, Washington Post Review: ""The movie 'CODA' reminds us that cliches sometimes work--and brilliantly."" 
Richard Brody, New York Post Review: ""'CODA' is a Feel-Bad, Feel-Good Movie.""
Owen Glieberman, Variety Review, ""Sian Heder's Family Drama Kicks Off Sundance on a Note of Enthralling Emotion.""
Tomris Laffly, Ebert Review, ""CODA.""

Step #2:  Review the worksheet on using a synthesis matrix featured in this week's Content.
Step #3:  Complete a synthesis matrix for the three articles you've read. This includes:

Identify at least three (3) main ideas or topics covered by the reviews (e.g., plot, actors, bias, etc.)
Take notes on what the critics write about these main ideas (e.g., ""Critic 1 praises the plot as interesting…"" and ""Critic 2 finds the plot too contrived…"")
Jotting down quotes that support your observations (e.g., ""Critic 3 writes, 'The story has movie-goers at the edge of their seats the whole three hours…"")

Step #4:  Identify at least two key issues or questions that are particularly problematic or controversial or striking or worthy of exploring.   These would be issues/questions that can be supported by at least two of the articles.  They may be points on which the critics agree or disagree, issues that weren't adequately addressed, or ideas that are explored in the reviews (e.g., ""What did the critics think about the actors' performances?"" or ""Discussion of bias in the movie's portrayal of deaf culture"").  Ask yourself, what ideas/issues that are shared among the articles might be interesting to pursue further? Using specific quotations and transitional phrases, discuss how the reviewers' opinions are similar, or different.
Step #5:  Explain how these issues are played out in the reviews (1-2 sentences).  What are the critics' positions on these issues?  What was stated/not stated? What other questions does this issue introduce? (For example, for ""Why didn't the critics recognize the cinematography?"" you might write about how one critic barely mentioned the cinematography, while another stated how it was overrated, focusing more on the acting.) In a paragraph, discuss how reviewers approached topics and themes in the films. You can use specific quotes and cite the reviews in text using APA guidelines. 
Note that a sample response to this discussion, based on three reviews of Danny Boyle's _Steve Jobs_, appears in the Content for this week.
Step #6:  Post your matrix, your two issues/questions, and your 1-2 sentence analysis.
Step #7:  Respond to one or two of your classmates' posts.
Please note that you will not be able to see other students' responses to this discussion topic until you post your response.

He had been well until two days ago, when he began to experience severe nausea several hours after eating two burritos for supper. The burritos had been ordered from a local fast-food restaurant. The nausea persisted and he vomited twice with some relief. As the evening progressed, he continued to feel “very bad” and took some Pepto-Bismol to help settle his stomach. Soon thereafter, he began to feel achy and warm. His temperature at the time was 100. 5°F. He has continued to experience nausea, vomiting, and a fever. He has not been able to tolerate any solid foods or liquids. Since yesterday, he has had 5–6 watery bowel movements. He has not noticed any blood in the stools. His wife brought him to the ER because he was becoming weak and dizzy when he tried to stand up. His wife denies any recent travel, use of antibiotics, laxatives, or excessive caffeine, or that her husband has an eating disorder.   Case Study Questions

DISCUSSION," In 2010, the Affordable Care Act opens up the 45-year-old Medicare program to the biggest changes since its inception. Discuss the components of the Affordable Care Act that you think will have a positive effect on improving health care outcomes and decreasing costs. ",Nursing,Nurs,,
REPLY TO A DISCUSSION," 
   We believe the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has had a favorable influence on healthcare outcomes and prices, as has been discussed. Medicaid expansion under the ACA was a significant step in the right direction since it allowed low-income people who did not qualify for Medicaid but could not afford private insurance to access low-cost healthcare options (Crowley et al., 2019). The expansion of medical coverage made early diagnosis and prevention of disease possible, leading to better health outcomes and fewer, less costly trips to the emergency room.
     We concur that improvements in healthcare outcomes may be directly attributed to the changes in insurance procedures mandated by the law, in particular the limitation on excessive payments based on an individual's medical history. Because of this provision, people with chronic illnesses are more likely to seek out life-saving medical care and treatment without worrying about being turned away or paying exorbitant fees (Crowley et al., 2019; Neiman et al., 2021). This, in turn, has resulted in better health outcomes and cost savings in the long run. Another favorable aspect of the legislation is the establishment of insurance marketplaces. Competitive pressure from these business hubs among safety net providers has resulted in lower rates and more flexible coverage options for consumers.
     Prevention and wellness programs, which the ACA encourages, have also helped boost health and save costs. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has helped reduce the prevalence of chronic illnesses by requiring insurance providers to provide preventative care without requiring patients to pay anything out of pocket. Community-based preventive programs have received money to assist projects addressing obesity, cigarette use, and drug addiction, all of which have the potential to reduce long-term costs by reducing the frequency with which costly treatments and hospitalizations are required (Crowley et al., 2019). Besides, the accountable care organizations (ACOs) that have been established as a result of the ACA`s payment changes have promoted the provision of care that is both high in quality and efficient in its use of resources. In exchange for coordinating treatment, preventing illness, and effectively managing chronic illnesses, ACOs provide financial incentives to healthcare providers.",Nursing,Nurs,,
REPLY TO A DISCUSSION," 
In 2010, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) into law. ACA was the most significant healthcare reform since the country implemented the Medicaid program 45 years ago. The law transformed the country’s healthcare system by enhancing healthcare outcomes and lowering costs. The law reformed the private insurance market, expanded the Medicaid healthcare program to low-income workers with earnings up to 133 % of the country’s poverty level, and changed how healthcare providers make medical decisions to encourage value-based care. The Act held that individuals and institutions would act according to these reforms to improve medical care access and lower costs financed by spreading the risk across a large pool, which results in affordable care.
The Act has various components that lower healthcare costs. It provides health insurance tax credits to small businesses to enable them to provide health coverage to their employees. Over four million businesses receive tax credits to enable them to provide health insurance benefits to employees. In addition, the Act sends a $ 250 rebate to over four million eligible elderly persons to cover their prescription medication. It also provides free preventive care for certain services like mammograms. Seniors also receive discounts for prescription drugs and free preventive medical care for services like wellness checks. These components reduce out-of-pocket costs, which lowers healthcare costs. Also, the Act expanded Medicaid eligibility criteria to cover more people from poor backgrounds and prohibited insurance companies from denying people health coverage due to pre-existing conditions (Courtemanche et al., 2019). It also extends healthcare coverage to young adults by allowing them to remain on their parent’s insurance coverage until they reach 26 years. These components allow more people to access affordable healthcare. Moreover, the Act provides tax credits for more people to afford health insurance. It also provides insurance premium support to people earning 150 % of the country’s poverty level to increase healthcare insurance coverage (Zhao et al., 2020). These interventions make healthcare affordable.
In addition, the law contains various components that improve healthcare outcomes. It established the Prevention and Public Health Fund, a dedicated disease and illness fund to ensure a healthier nation. It also links payment to health outcomes, incentivizing healthcare settings to enhance quality. It also encourages integrated healthcare under accountable care organizations, allowing diverse healthcare providers to collaborate to coordinate care provision, improve care quality, prevent illnesses, and reduce hospital readmission (Chait & Glied,, 2018). It also enhances care for the elderly after they are released from the hospital by connecting them to community-based services to manage their conditions better. ACA components lower costs and improve health outcomes.",Nursing,NURSE ,,

Minimum Weekly DB Expectations

Post an original and thoughtful Main Post to the DB prompt.
Respond to at least 2 other posts from learners and/or the instructor (Response Posts).
The first contribution (Main Post or Response Post) must be posted before midnight (Central time) on Friday of each week.
Two additional responses are required after Friday of each week.
For DB assignment prompts with a Part One and Part Two, Part One should be addressed in the first week of the unit with a Main Post and minimum of 2 Response Posts, and Part Two should be addressed in the second week of the unit with a Main Post and a minimum of 2 Response Posts.

More on DBs
At the end of each unit, DB participation is assessed based on level of engagement and the quality of the contribution to the discussion. DBs allow learners to learn through sharing ideas and experiences as they relate to course content. Because it is not possible to engage in two-way dialogue after a conversation has ended, no posts to the DB are accepted after the end of the unit. Learners must demonstrate an appropriate depth of understanding of course content to receive credit for having submitted substantive posts. Typically, this is achieved with 3–4 strong paragraphs for Main Posts and 2–3 strong paragraphs for Response Posts.
This DB has three parts:

Writing a mission statement requires focus and should inspire not only the employees within an organization but the customers, suppliers and community as a whole.  What are the nine basic components of a mission statement? Why is it important to include as many of these components as possible in a company’s mission statement?
There are many analytical tools and techniques available for companies to gauge not only where they stand within the industry but to also assess their sustainability and competitive advantage within the marketplace.  Why do you believe it is an important step within a strategic planning process to conduct a SWOT analysis?  How can a VRIO help an organization?

discussion forum:
Sun Zu, the famous war general, once stated that to ensure victory in battle, one needs to have knowledge of the enemy and knowledge of oneself. This is also true in healthcare. Data plays a crucial role in ensuring that a patient is attended to properly (Silvia & Cotter, 2021). For example, as part of its measures to become more proactive in its care, the hospital collected and analyzed data from electronic health records to determine the health demographics associated with those affected mainly by depression and anxiety (Silvia & Cotter, 2021).
 In this case, the hospital collected data that included patient demographics such as age, race, and financial status. The hospital also took patient history data and current treatment plans (HR & Aithal, 2022). This data all comes from their electronic health records. The hospital also looked at their health insurance claim data. These are all elements that would help the hospital establish the characteristics of patients who are most likely to develop depression and anxiety (HR & Aithal, 2022). The knowledge can be used to show what factors contribute to the development of these illnesses, and this knowledge can help the hospital make better interventions to address them (HR & Aithal, 2022). The knowledge can also help the hospital determine which demographics are most affected by the disease.
 A nurse leader can use clinical reasoning and judgment to form knowledge from this experience in various ways (Wei et al., 2019). One of the ways is to identify discrepancies. A nurse leader can identify possible errors within the research. This can further enhance the research results while ensuring that the nurse leader gains knowledge. The nurse leader can also use clinical reasoning and judgment to establish knowledge by determining the appropriate ways to apply the data (Wei et al., 2019). It is not only essential to know something but to apply it. This will lead to the growth of knowledge. Nurse leaders determine the appropriate places to apply the data in a way that benefits both the hospital and the individual using the information from the research into depression and anxiety.

first draft," 
the readings have discussed how a democracy requires thinking about how we treat each other, engage those with differing beliefs and values, and form relationships founded upon “unity in diversity” (hooks, 2003, p. 109). The readings raise two important challenges to political systems that we will be grappling with this semester:

Negotiating differences to create a sense of shared community
Addressing deep injustices that have made some people thrive at the direct expense of others

The question becomes: How do we create a society where differences can be valued and appreciated and where all people can flourish? This question is the foundation of social movements and communication scholarship targeted toward social change.
For this writing assignment, you will reflect on what are the barriers or opportunities for building “relationships that are more equal; less conditioned by economic, political, or social power; and more respectful of mutual humanity” (Keith and Danisch, 2020, p. 7). In other words, you will consider what are the current challenges for creating meaningful relationships founded upon difference, humility, and shared responsibility and what are some possibilities for addressing those challenges. In your paper, you should reflect on the following:

The importance of communication and social change for democracy
How communication and social change negotiate differences, create community, and address injustice

These are some big topics. Do not feel you need to have all the answers or approach this in any specific way. Think about how you are making sense of the readings and how they have helped you better understand democracy, communication, social change, social responsibility, etc.  If you are confused or would like me to look over your draft before you submit, please don't hesitate to reach out. 
The draft of these papers will be 2-3 pages double-spaced. You will revise these papers over the following two weeks expanding and nuancing the position you take in this paper. NOTE: This is just a draft, meaning view this as an opportunity to get your ideas on the page. THEN, as we read more and you have more discussions and lectures, you will be able to revise and polish your response.
This paper is one of the three you will write and revise throughout the semester. Your first draft will be 2-3 pages, whereas your final draft will be 3-4. Your first draft should include 2-3 citations from the class. Your final draft should include 4-5. You should cite your sources in APA, MLA, or Chicago format.

Fred’s comment to Eric could easily be frustration on his part but also considered a threat to sabotage Eric’s efforts to select qualified engineers to take the assignment to Mexico. What would you do, and why?
Fred has been a valuable employee, excelling in his international assignment, but he now is experiencing possible burnout and frustration over the extension of the assignment beyond the original agreements. A major reason for the delay is that he did not effectively get the job done because of lengthy delays stemming from his hesitation to hand things over to host country engineers. He was also ineffective in adapting to host country officials and regulations. How would you address this with Fred?
Eric recognizes that Juanita Roberto, vice president of HR, is pushing for budget reductions and is advocating a do-more-with-less philosophy in the expatriate program. This includes changing pre-departure training for employees and family members. Eric’s current plan is effective, but he recognizes that a serious deficiency is the language training; it will require an increase rather than a decrease in spending. The language training is vital to success. How should Eric convince Juanita of the importance of investing in better language training for expatriates?

touch stone 1.1," You’ve learned how a resume can help you achieve your career goals. Now it’s time to build your own. In this , you will use the tools, templates, and examples to create your own professional resume that highlights your skills and experience for potential employers.

Use the template and sample below to assist in the creation of your resume.



In order to foster learning and growth, all work you submit must be newly written specifically for this course. Any recycled work will be sent back with a 0, and you will be given one attempt to redo the Touchstone.
A. Directions
Step 1: Preparations
Before you create your resume, complete the following steps:
a. Collect the personal information needed (such as dates of jobs, graduation, etc.) to complete your resume.b. Review the rubric to see the specifics for each grading criteria.c. Review the Sophia tutorials provided in the course for tips and guidelines:

Resume
A Targeted Resume

Step 2: Creation
Open the resume template and add your details. When creating your resume, pay attention to your formatting. Formatting is usually the first thing someone notices about a resume. Despite what you may have heard, having a colorful, elaborate resume is not required, nor is it preferable except for in a few unusual industries. All that extra design and color makes it difficult for an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to read, meaning your resume could be thrown out without being considered. An effectively-formatted resume is concise and uses a consistent style throughout the entire document, which makes it easy to read. Clear presentation ensures that your most important information will stand at first glance.
Once you have created your resume, you can use Jobscan to scan your resume. After you upload your resume and a related job posting, Jobscan will analyze your resume and give you a score to help you see how well you’ve tailored your resume to the role.

Refer to the checklist below throughout the Touchstone process. Do not submit your Touchstone until it meets these guidelines.
Visual Appeal
❒ Does your resume use an 11-12 point professional and legible font, such as Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman, Verdana, or Tahoma?
❒ Does your resume use consistent fonts and font sizes throughout (larger, uniform fonts for headers; smaller, uniform fonts for descriptions)?
❒ Do you consistently format text using bold, italics, or underlining for emphasis (e.g., bold job titles, underline key information)?
❒ Did you avoid the use of color or graphics? Traditional resume styles are preferred for most fields.
❒ Did you set up your page margins at 0.75 to 1.25 inches on all sides?
❒ Did you use single spacing throughout, with a blank line between each section of content?
❒ Did you use bullet points instead of paragraphs of text when describing your accomplishments in your experience sections?
❒ Did you utilize the touchstone template to create and customize your own resume?
❒ Did you use a format that is formatted for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)?
❒ Did you include your full name in the file name?

Content
❒ Is your resume written in the first person?
❒ Are verbs in the correct tense?
❒ Is your contact information complete?
❒ Did you make sure that there is no inappropriate information?

❒ Does each listing have a title, organization name, and the scope of the role?
❒ Does each listing include dates of employment, such as 05/2020 – 06/2021 or May 2020 – June 2021?
❒ Does each listing have bullet points to detail specifics?
❒ Does each listing include positive content?
❒ Does each listing have consistent verb usage and correct punctuation?
Summary/Objective
❒ If you chose to include a summary, is it 3-4 sentences? If you instead chose to include an objective, is it one concise sentence?
❒ Is your summary/objective present at the top of the resume?
❒ Does your summary/objective clearly state the target position, relevant skills, and benefits that you would bring to the position?

Conventions
❒ Did you carefully proofread your document to ensure that it is error-free? Your resume is a chance to make a strong first impression, as it serves as a sample of your writing, and demonstrates your attention to detail.
❒ Is your document the correct length of 1 pg",Education,Help,Homework,

She typically plans out every minute of her day and expects meetings to have clear agendas with concise information about daily tasks. The culture is low context and values certainty and formality. Sarah has worked in the organization for nearly 20 years.
 
•  Joe: At the company’s Southeast branch, Joe’s team values a relaxed and informal atmosphere. He and his colleagues focus a lot of energy on developing genuine relationships and trust. Joe and his coworkers use a high-context communication style. Joe is the newest hire out of this branch but has been working in the organization for 10 years.
 
•  Blake: At Blake’s branch in the Southwest, his team values collaborating, sharing work, and equally contributing to ideas. The culture tends to focus on equal distribution of workload and people who desire to improve the success of the overall group. They generally communicate in a nonassertive manner. Blake has been working in the organization for 30 years.
 
•  Talia: At Talia’s branch in the Midwest, the culture is friendly and warm. People are very supportive of each other and value kindness and expressions of appreciation. They, at times, have difficulty communicating criticism. They are largely assertive and uncomfortable with silence. Talia was recently promoted, and she has worked for the organization for 5 years.
 
•  Mei: At Mei’s West Coast branch, employees can work in the office building, outside on patios, or on lawn spaces.

Social Science - Sociology Sociology Last Assignment,"our final assignment for the course,  will follow the basic structure of a “What I Learned” piece in Contexts, a quarterly magazine published by the American Sociological Association. This is not a research assignment. You are not expected to collect data, review literature we haven’t covered in class, or include a formal reference list. Rather, you should apply at least 3 theories or concepts we learned in the class this term to your life in a thoughtful way, discussing specific articles and authors. This means that you must cite specific course resources and articles (about 2-3 citations per written page). The assignment should be written in the first person, describing some aspect of your own life experience through a sociological lens, and may be no longer than 1100 words in length. I’ll recommend the best assignment in the class for publication in Contexts. Pay close attention to your word count: I will automatically deduct a letter grade if you go over the word limit. Since the word limit for this assignment is imposed by the magazine, assignment longer than 1100 words will be ineligible for consideration at Contexts. 4 examples of ""What I Learned""  are listed below.

Overview
Health care organizations face many unprecedented challenges and opportunities. Diversity is a major challenge that continues to overwhelm management teams. This challenge is noticeable in top leadership roles in health care where a lack of diversity exists in the areas of gender, ethnicity, and race. There is a documented need for diverse leadership teams with transformational leadership skills to successfully lead organizations. Remediation of this gap is critical to the advancement of health care delivery and systems. Senior management must consider the deficiency and develop a strategic process to invoke change.
Suppose you are the executive director of the hypothetical organization Better Health Today, LLC. The board of directors has informed you that the organization has missed out on major federal funding opportunities over the past three to five years. The grant reviewer's feedback describes the organization's lack of diversity and community support to promote social change. The board of directors has asked you to review the issues noted in the reviewer's feedback and provide recommendations to improve the reputation of the company.
Instructions

Evidence-Based Practice in Nursing," 
Today is week 1 day 2.  I need discussion question by Weds.  The picot question in this discussion question will be the question for the paper.  So I need discussion question complete and the 3 part paper.
Discussion: Nursing Research and Evidence-Based Practice
In your practice as a nurse, you may use procedures and methods that did not necessarily originate in evidence, but instead were derived from informal and unwritten conventions, traditions, and observations. While these techniques may have merit, practices are constantly being updated and contradicted by information from scholarly research studies and professional guidelines. This new information serves as “evidence” for revising practices to improve outcomes across health care.
Based on this evidence, you can formulate a question. In this Discussion, you consider the use of evidence-based practice in your own organization and formulate a question that you will need to answer for your portfolio project. This is called a PICOT question. You will also investigate strategies for overcoming barriers to implementing evidence-based practice (EBP).
To prepare: 

Consider a recent clinical experience in which you were providing care for a patient.
Determine the extent to which the care that you provided was based on evidence and research findings or supported only by your organization’s standard procedures. How do you know if the tasks were based on research?
What questions have you thought about in a particular area of care such as a procedure or policy?
Review Chapter 2, pages 31–34 on “Asking Well worded Clinical Questions” in Polit & Beck and consult the resource from the Walden Student Center for Success: Clinical Question Anatomy & examples of PICOT questions (found in this week’s Learning Resources). Formulate your background questions and PICOT question.
Reflect on the barriers that might inhibit the implementation of evidence-based practice in your clinical environment.
Review the article “Adopting Evidence-Based Practice in Clinical Decision Making” in this week’s Learning Resources. Select one of the barriers described that is evident in your organization and formulate a plan for overcoming this barrier.

By Day 3
Post an evaluation of the use, or lack thereof, of EBP in a recent clinical experience. Identify which aspects of the care delivered, if any, were based on evidence and provide your rationale. List your background questions and PICOT question about this nursing topic. Critique how the policies, procedures, and culture in your organization may hinder or support the adoption of evidence-based practices. Identify the barrier you selected from the article and explain how this barrier could be overcome within your organization.
Course Project: Part 1—Identifying a Researchable Problem
One of the most challenging aspects of EBP is to actually identify the answerable question.
—Karen Sue Davies
Formulating a question that targets the goal of your research is a challenging but essential task. The question plays a crucial role in all other aspects of the research, including the determination of the research design and theoretical perspective to be applied, which data will be collected, and which tools will be used for analysis. It is therefore essential to take the time to ensure that the research question addresses what you actually want to study. Doing so will increase your likelihood of obtaining meaningful results.
In this first component of the Course Project, you formulate questions to address a particular nursing issue or problem. You use the PICOT model—patient/population, intervention/issue, comparison, and outcome—outlined in the Learning Resources to design your questions.
To prepare:

Review the article, “Formulating the Evidence Based Practice Question: A Review of the Frameworks,” found in the Learning Resources for this week. Focus on the PICOT model for guiding the development of research questions.
Review the section beginning on page 75 of the course text, titled, “Developing and Refining Research Problems” in the course text, which focuses on analyzing the feasibility of a research problem.
Reflect on an issue or problem that you have noticed in your nursing practice. Consider the significance of this issue or problem.
Generate at least five questions that relate to the issue which you have identified. Use the criteria in your course text to select one question that would be most appropriate in terms of significance, feasibility, and interest. Be prepared to explain your rationale.
Formulate a preliminary PICO question—one that is answerable—based on your analysis. What are the PICO variables (patient/population, intervention/issue, comparison, and outcome) for this question?

Note: Not all of these variables may be appropriate to every question. Be sure to analyze which are and are not relevant to your specific question.

Using the PICOT variables that you determined for your question, develop a list of at least 10 keywords that could be used when conducting a literature search to investigate current research pertaining to the question.

To complete:
Write a 3- to 4-page paper that includes the following:

A summary of your area of interest, an identification of the problem that you have selected, and an explanation of the significance of this problem for nursing practice
The 5 questions you have generated and a description of how you analyzed them for feasibility
Your preliminary PICOT question and a description of each PICOT variable relevant to your question
At least 10 possible keywords that could be used when conducting a literature search for your PICOT question and a rationale for your selections

By Day 7
Submit your Project. It will also be a component of your Portfolio Assignment for this course, which is due by Day 7 of Week 10.

2nd part
Course Project: Part 2—Literature Review
This is a continuation of the Course Project presented in Week 2. Before you begin, review the Course Project Overview document located in the Week 2 Resources area.
The literature review is a critical piece in the research process because it helps a researcher determine what is currently known about a topic and identify gaps or further questions. Conducting a thorough literature review can be a time-consuming process, but the effort helps establish the foundation for everything that will follow. For this part of your Course Project, you will conduct a brief literature review to find information on the question you developed in Week 2. This will provide you with experience in searching databases and identifying applicable resources.
To prepare:

Review the information in Chapter 5 of the course text, focusing on the steps for conducting a literature review and for compiling your findings.
Using the question you selected in your Week 2 Project (Part 1 of the Course Project), locate 5 or more full-text research articles that are relevant to your PICOT question. Include at least 1 systematic review and 1 integrative review if possible. Use the search tools and techniques mentioned in your readings this week to enhance the comprehensiveness and objectivity of your review. You may gather these articles from any appropriate source, but make sure at least 3 of these articles are available as full-text versions through Walden Library’s databases.
Read through the articles carefully. Eliminate studies that are not appropriate and add others to your list as needed. Although you may include more, you are expected to include a minimum of five articles. Complete a literature review summary table using the Literature Review Summary Table Template located in this week’s Learning Resources.
Prepare to summarize and synthesize the literature using the information on writing a literature review found in Chapter 5 of the course text.

To complete:
Write a 3- to 4-page literature review that includes the following:

A synthesis of what the studies reveal about the current state of knowledge on the question that you developed
    
Point out inconsistencies and contradictions in the literature and offer possible explanations for inconsistencies.


Preliminary conclusions on whether the evidence provides strong support for a change in practice or whether further research is needed to adequately address your inquiry
Your literature review summary table with all references formatted in correct APA style

Note: Certain aspects of conducting a standard review of literature have not yet been covered in this course. Therefore, while you are invited to critically examine any aspect of the studies (e.g., a study’s design, appropriateness of the theoretic framework, data sampling methods), your conclusion should be considered preliminary. Bear in mind that five studies are typically not enough to reflect the full range of knowledge on a particular question and you are not expected to be familiar enough with research methodology to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of all aspects of the studies.
By Day 7 of Week 5
This part of the Course Project is due. It will also be a component in your Portfolio Assignment in this course, which is due by Day 7 of Week 10.
3rd part
Course Project: Part 3—Translating Evidence Into Practice
In Part 3 of the Course Project, you consider how the evidence you gathered during Part 2 can be translated into nursing practice.
Now that you have located available research on your PICOT question, you will examine what the research indicates about nursing practices. Connecting research evidence and findings to actual decisions and tasks that nurses complete in their daily practice is essentially what evidence-based practice is all about. This final component of the Course Project asks you to translate the evidence and data from your literature review into authentic practices that can be adopted to improve health care outcomes. In addition, you will also consider possible methods and strategies for disseminating evidence-based practices to your colleagues and to the broader health care field.
To prepare:

Consider Parts 1 and 2 of your Course Project. How does the research address your PICOT question?
With your PICOT question in mind, identify at least one nursing practice that is supported by the evidence in two or more of the articles from your literature review. Consider what the evidence indicates about how this practice contributes to better outcomes.
Explore possible consequences of failing to adopt the evidence-based practice that you identified.
Consider how you would disseminate information about this evidence-based practice throughout your organization or practice setting. How would you communicate the importance of the practice?

To complete:
In a 3- to 4-page paper:

Restate your PICOT question and its significance to nursing practice.
Summarize the findings from the articles you selected for your literature review. Describe at least one nursing practice that is supported by the evidence in the articles. Justify your response with specific references to at least 2 of the articles.
Explain how the evidence-based practice that you identified contributes to better outcomes. In addition, identify potential negative outcomes that could result from failing to use the evidence-based practice.
Outline the strategy for disseminating the evidence-based practice that you identified throughout your practice setting. Explain how you would communicate the importance of the practice to your colleagues. Describe how you would move from disseminating the information to implementing the evidence-based practice within your organization. How would you address concerns and opposition to the change in practice?

By Day 7 of Week 10
This part of the Course Project is due. It should be combined with the other two components of the Course Project and turned in as your Portfolio Assignment for this course.
Note: In addition, include a 1-page summary of your project.
For this final iteration, you will need to:

Submit your paper to Grammarly and SafeAssign through the Walden Writing Center. Based on the Grammarly and SafeAssign reports, revise your paper as necessary.
Reminder: The School of Nursing requires that all papers submitted include a title page, introduction, summary, and references.

INTRODUCTIONAs a business manager, you may encounter situations that require a wide variety of communication responses. For this assessment, you will be creating a portfolio of communication documents. Please appropriately format each communication for the message type.SCENARIO
Scenario 1
You are a manager of a company that has recently purchased and merged with a smaller company. The purchased company has an existing product, which will now be part of your product offering. The product is a weight-loss supplement called Kamelon. The product has been very successful for the previous owner, but the company had a limited ability to adjust its manufacturing system to accommodate growth, as well as a limited potential sales audience. Your role is to oversee and coordinate all aspects of launching the product from the newly acquired company. You have a far greater manufacturing capacity and more potential customers readily available because you already sell several weight loss-related products to a large base of customers.
Kamelon has been proven successful by a limited research study. The study consisted of 100 participants, 90% of whom lost at least 15 pounds over a reasonable time period. To date, the study participants who lost at least 15 pounds have successfully maintained their weight loss by continuing to use the product, and 80% were able to maintain their weight loss with continued use of Kamelon. The 10% of study participants who lost less than 15 pounds may have been unsuccessful because they did not follow the program’s protocol. An inherent risk of a weight-loss product is the inability to determine whether the product has produced results or if the user has not followed directions. Dissatisfied customers present a challenge as a result.
Your success relies on your external business partner Synesthor, who continues to manufacture the pill casing for Kamelon. There is a need for 10 million pills to be manufactured in the next three months to meet the demands of your customers. Synesthor is a manufacturing company located in South America, and you will need to work closely with this partner to ensure their manufacturing operation is able to meet the demand as needed in a just-in-time environment. Your contact’s name at Synesthor is Fatima Sousa.
You have received a customer complaint via the company’s social media page. The customer is extremely dissatisfied, and the complaint has negatively impacted the company’s image. The customer’s complaint is as follows: “Kamelon does not work! I’ve been using this for a week, and I haven’t lost anything! I’m going on vacation in a couple of weeks, and I was hoping to shed a couple of pounds before I left for my trip. Unfortunately, I do not foresee this happening. No one should buy this product! As a faithful member of several weight-loss groups, I will not recommend this product to anyone in my groups.”
Scenario 2
You are a manager in a small pharmaceutical distributor. Your company has been awarded an exclusive contract to distribute a new medication.
Nasaquil is an over-the-counter medication that has been approved to treat influenza. Nasaquil will compete directly with prescription antiviral medications.
Your company, through your sales and customer service representatives, already has extensive relationships with medical providers. There is great anticipation within the market about the potential efficacy of this new medication. According to estimates by a government agency, from 2010 to 2020, there were approximately 9 to 41 million flu illnesses with an estimated 12,000 to 52,000 flu-related deaths in the United States.
Initial clinical trials indicate that Nasaquil may help to lower influenza’s severity and duration; however, clinical trials only demonstrate a new medication’s efficacy in a small group of patients over a limited amount of time. Long-term product efficacy rates have not yet been established. As with all new medication launches, your company anticipates patient dissatisfaction if desired results are not achieved. In those cases, the company will work directly with the patients.
The success of Nasaquil relies on an external business partner located in Europe, Pruhart Tech, that manufactures the refrigerated casing designed specifically for this product. The product is required to be shipped overnight in a temperature-controlled package. Unfortunately, Pruhart Tech has limited refrigerated shipping containers, and the availability is restricted to weekend deliveries only. You will need to work closely with this partner to ensure that their manufacturing operation is able to increase as needed in a just-in-time environment to meet sales demands. Your contact’s name at Pruhart Tech is Diego Garcia.
You have received a customer complaint via the company’s social media page. The customer is extremely dissatisfied, and the complaint has negatively impacted the company’s image. The customer’s complaint is as follows: “Nasaquil does not work! My wife started Nasaquil and got very ill! I don’t understand how big pharma companies get away with rolling out unsafe drugs that can hurt people! Dealing with all of the medical appointments and issues is bad enough, but this sickness . . . I cannot wait for the patient support meeting tomorrow to share this medication’s reaction. Maybe this drug shouldn’t be approved yet.”
Scenario 3
You are a manager of a research company. Your research team has developed a transition package that allows a gas-powered engine to transition to run on biofuels. The availability and low cost of biofuels make the transition package a potential game changer in the automobile market. You have named the product Sparkit.
In addition to tests completed by your staff, you have partnered with a large automobile manufacturer to ensure that the transition package works with many different types of vehicles. The large automobile manufacturer remains a partner in the product as a result of their involvement, and you anticipate that future vehicles from the producer may use the technology when initially built. With the manufacturer’s assistance, you anticipate that 50% of cars currently on the road can potentially be retrofitted with your product. The automobile manufacturer has created a guide for your sales force to ensure that Sparkit is not sold to customers whose cars are not compatible with the product.
This is the first big product developed by your company. Your sales and service teams do not have current relationships with potential buyers. One potential risk is that purchasers may choose to install the transition package on their own rather than choose a knowledgeable automotive professional to install it. You anticipate that there may be issues with installation as a result.
The success of Sparkit relies on an external partner in Asia, Autojor, that manufactures a filter critical to the proper operation of the transition package. As the result of a natural disaster, Autojor recently lost a manufacturing plant that was responsible for producing 25% of your inventory. You will need to work closely with this partner to ensure that their manufacturing operation is able to continue supporting the just-in-time environment to meet sales demands. Your contact’s name at Autojor is Mateo Kalani.
You have received a customer complaint via the company’s social media page. The customer is extremely dissatisfied, and the complaint has negatively impacted the company’s image. The customer’s complaint is as follows: “I bought and installed Sparkit. It doesn’t work! The instructions do not match my engine’s layout, and now my car doesn’t work at all. This was supposed to save me money, but now my car won’t run. I’ll have to put more money into getting it fixed. This is ridiculous. I have told all my friends, and now I am telling the world—do not buy this product! If you do, you will regret it.”

Week 9 Discussion - Relational Set Operators
25 Unread replies25 Replies     
A  relational database model allows database users to analyze data  thoroughly. To accomplish this, advanced commands such as ""union"" and  ""intersect"" may be used.

Describe a business scenario where a ""union"" relational set operator may be used to merge two similar data sets.
Analyze  the analysis and data consistency advantages of using a ""union""  operator rather than simply merging two data sets into one result table,  within the context of your business scenario.
Be sure to respond to at least one of your classmates' posts.

Hello Class,
We consider a scenario where a business wants to combine customer  data from two different sources: an online store and a physical retail  location. The physical retail store maintains a separate database with  similar customer information but includes additional information like  addresses and phone numbers. The online store carries a database with  customer information such as names, email addresses, and purchase  history. The ""union"" relational set operator combines these two related  datasets. The union operator eliminates duplicate rows by combining the  rows from two tables into a single result set. In this instance, it  would enable the business to integrate customer information from the  physical and online stores, building a comprehensive customer database  with all available data (Radovanovic, D., 2019).
The ""union"" operator has several benefits for analysis and data  consistency. First of all, it makes sure that the merged dataset doesn't  contain any duplicate entries. By removing duplicates, the company  could avoid potential mistakes and inconsistencies if the data were  combined without using the ""union"" operator. As a result, the dataset  for analysis becomes more accurate and cleaner. Additionally, the  ""union"" operator makes it simple to identify new clients from both  sources (Radovanovic, D., 2019). The company can identify customers who  have interacted with both the online and physical retail stores by  comparing the combined dataset with the individual datasets from each.  Understanding customer behavior, preferences, and cross-channel  purchasing patterns can be done with the help of this information.
Comprehensive analysis of the customer data is made possible by the  ""union"" operator. The combined dataset offers a comprehensive view of  customer interactions across various channels, enabling the business to  learn more about the preferences and behavior of its customers. This can  all be aided by creating personalized marketing strategies, enhancing  customer support, and improving product offerings. In integrating  customer data, using the ""union"" operator to merge two comparable  datasets offers analysis and data consistency benefits. It guarantees  the removal of duplicates, enables customer identification across  various sources, and facilitates thorough customer behavior analysis.  These benefits help the business make more informed decisions and more  precise insights. Rewrite this text for me, going into more detail about  each point.

HISCO Summary Annual Report,"DUE AT MIDNIGHT EASTERN STANDARD TIME ON JUNE 5TH, 2023
TOTAL OF 18 PAGES MINIMUM 


Prior to gaining access to the Summary Annual Report. Download Summary Annual Report Template.
The summary annual report is a scaled down version of a full annual report. Naturally, you are encouraged to review real world annual reports which can be used as a strawman in preparation. Your recently completed Annual Operating Review should be aligned with your Annual Report.
Preparing your HISCO summary annual report will be one of the most comprehensive assignments you will have completed so far. You will gain an appreciation for the complexity and responsibility the senior executives continually face. Hopefully, you have experienced the holistic and competitive environment from the simulation. Your recently completed Annual Operating Review will provide the basics.
The information, qualitative and quantitative, in an annual report should provide current and prospective investors (as well as any stakeholder) a complete insight into the company’s historic performance and its plans for growth and improvement over the next few years as defined by its strategy. Publicly traded companies are required by law to prepare and submit to many constituencies a variety of filings.  The most well-known is the Annual Report to Shareholders and related Form 10-K. An annual report is technically an unofficial document. The Form 10-K will typically provide the most comprehensive summary of the company’s history, financials, risks and opportunities, and current operations. The Form 10-K is submitted annually to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Technically, HISCO is a private company (you may have sold equity to the venture capitalist) and only if it had publicly trades debt would be required to file a Form 10K.
As a future leader of a public or private company, you will learn the integrative nature of any business while you complete the HISCO summary annual report.  This document can become an important part of your e-portfolio in the program.  Your owner, Stanley Sloane, looks forward to reading your HISCO summary annual report.  While details may vary state by state, even if your career leads to growing a small private business, you will need to file an annual report with The Secretary of State in your jurisdiction, another benefit to learning from our final activity.
The following identifies specifics instructions for preparation of each required section.  The required sections to be completed will be found the word document from the model. Please remember to periodically save your work.  An online search will reveal innumerable sites devoted to annual reports.
The HISCO Summary Annual Report

Must be completed using the template Summary Annual Report Template a guide to formatting your work. Standard APA formatting will not apply to this assignment.
Must include the following:
    
Cover Page

You can design your own cover page. Should be reflective of your corporate image and may include a picture and/or logo. At a minimum, it will include the name, [year 2024] HISCO Summary Annual Report, as well as your name and date. The cover page can only be 1 page.


CEO Letter

The CEO Letter is designed to share the Strategy, Financial Highlight Summary, and Business Overview of the past year. Evaluate quantitative and qualitative techniques for business analysis and decision-making. It will typically also include the future growth outlook for the business (detailed in the Sales, Marketing and Industry pages below). The CEO Letter can be a maximum of 3 pages.  


The ""Stan Sloane Letter""

HISCO’s owner, Stan Sloane, is very happy that he decided to hire you to help turn the company around. He is interested in having you stay on with the company. However, he will need assurance from you that you are committed to continuing to grow HISCO. Explain to Stan how you plan on running the company over the next two years. You should discuss the majority of the items you developed when you first came on with the company, including: whether you would make any changes to the SWOT analysis, whether you would change the company strategy, negotiations you would make with company stakeholders, future technology suggestions, growth expectations in general for the industry and specifically for HISCO over the next two years, any concerns that occurred in the past year that you would address, and any other information you believe would be relevant in order to reassure Stan that he has placed the company in the right hands. You will add this letter at the end of the standard Annual Report. This letter is not part of a traditional Annual Report. The “Stan Sloane Letter” can be 3-4 pages.


Sales, Marketing, & Industry

This section should detail all aspects of HISCO’s Value Chain, from supplier to manufacturing to the customer. Products, NPIs, Pricing, in an industry perspective of competition should be elaborated on. Utilize tools from marketing to manage the profitability of overall business operations. A review of your SWOT would probably help as well as your recently completed Annual Operating Review. An essential element is for current and prospective investors to understand how HISCO makes money and will be able to create growth and deal with risks. The Sales, Marketing & Industry section can be a maximum of 5 pages.


Financial Statements

Financial statements are the heart and soul of the annual report. This is a quantitative section that provides current and prospective investors a look into HISCOs financial performance. The financial statements consist of the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow. We suggest you show a minimum of 4 Qtrs. for each of the past two years for the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow. Utilize tools from finance management to manage the profitability of overall business operations. Consider expanding the lines within each statement in the model. You will need to provide details on the Credit Line. The Financial Statements section can be a maximum of 6 pages.


Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A)

The Management Discussion and Analysis section provides the real detail on year to year performance. In your case, this will be simulation year vs. prior simulation year. Topics will be both qualitative and quantitative in all aspects of simulation year relative to prior simulation year. MD&A will certainly include a complete variance analysis of performance and the successes and failures of your decisions for the year.  It is the time you will delve into the details of your operating decisions. The MD&A section is typically devoted to the past (your future was described in prior sections). Reference to the Financial Statements is crucial as well as your recently completed Annual Operating Review. Graphics from your Business Intelligence Dashboard and your Variance walks on Income and Cash can provide visual insight into your performance. The Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) can be a maximum of 6 pages.


Notes, Appendices, and References

Any supporting documents, comments, information, a glossary of terminology, and/or clarifications you deem relevant to your annual report to assist current and prospective investors. The Notes, Appendices, and References are required and can be a minimum of 1 page and a maximum of 2 pages.  References can be in a bulleted or numbered format.

Education Assignment,"Educating Peter is a short documentary that follows a special needs student with Down’s syndrome, in his inclusive third grade classroom. The film chronicles Peter’s first year at a public school, he was previously attending a school for students with special needs.
Educating Peter is a good example of the evolving history of special educationLinks to an external site..  The Education for All Handicapped Children Act passed in 1975 mandating that students with disabilities have access to public education- that was less than 50 years ago!  Prior to the law, children with disabilities were either educated in private schools if their parents could afford, or the state sponsored schools like those for the deaf and blind, or they were kept at home away from the public, or hospitalized in deplorable conditions. 
Today PL 94-142 is called The Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act, IDEA.  It was reauthorized in 2004 with an emphasis on inclusion, meaning that students with disabilities are entitled to be included in the general education to the maximum extent possible.   
As you watch the film Educating Peter take notes for the following questions you need to complete this assignment.  
1.  Describe the philosophy of the teacher. Give supporting details.  
2.  What were 3 barriers to Peter's inclusion?  How were the barriers overcome?  Explain your thinking and use examples from the film.   
3.  Describe the collaborations that you witnessed in the film.
4.  What kind of future do you think Peter is being prepared for?  
5.  What did you notice while you watched the film?  What thoughts do you have about students with disabilities?  Thoughts about including children with special needs in the general education classroom?  
6.  After watching the film, describe how Peter experienced FAPE, Free and Appropriate Public Education.

Module 4 Discussion,"I need this completed today by 11pm.
Consider the multiple theories of child development you have been studying in this module. (Refer to the lecture and chapter readings for assistance and supporting evidence.) For your initial post, identify one chosen specific theory that you feel you identify within your approach as an educator. Support your choice with statements and examples from your own experience and understanding.
Maturational Theory

Nature Approach.
Explains a child's development through genetics and biological changes.
Arnold Gesell's theory included the idea that all development is governed by internal changes and explained development by age, called milestones, which children achieved at set points in their lives.

Psychoanalytic and Psychosocial Theory

Child behavior and development are governed by the unconscious processes of mainly social and emotional development.
Sigmund Freud believed that children behaved according to inner conflicts and originated the Psychoanalytic Theory, which says that a child's personality is formed by how they resolve these inner conflicts.
Erik Erikson originated the Psychosocial Theory also believed that children learn by accomplishing certain inner conflicts. His theory is described as the Eight Stages of Man. The first four deal specifically with early childhood.
Trust versus      Mistrust -- ages birth through one year
Autonomy versus      Shame and Doubt -- ages 1-3 years
Initiative      versus Guilt -- ages 3-5 years
Industry versus      Inferiority -- ages 6-12 years

Cognitive-Developmental Theory

Nurture approach.
Constructivism believes that children learn and develop through actively exploring their environment.
Developmentally      Appropriate Practice (DAP) relies heavily on this theory.
Jean Piaget believed that children progress through four stages of intellectual (cognitive)      development.
Sensorimotor -      ages birth through 2 years
Preoperational      - ages 2-7 years
Concrete      Operational - ages 7-11 years
Formal      Operational - ages 11-15 years
Lev Vygotsky believed that social interactions also played a very active role in how children learned. With this, he also shared the importance of language and speech in a child's development and learning.
Zone of Proximal Development- children go through identified zones of development that are used to identify the child's next step or growth area
Scaffolding –  adults will assess the child's ability level and then intentionally plan      and guide with the goal of supporting the child's growth to the next level of ability
Maria Montessori believed that there are differences in how all children learn and that every child has great potential. She believed that through self-exploration the child will thrive, though it is up to educators and parents to provide the opportunities for this self-discovery.

Behaviorism and Social-Learning Theory

Nurture      Approach.
Development is based upon learned behaviors that are based upon a child's interactions with their environment and influenced by positive or negative reinforcement.
John Watson and B.F. Skinner introduced this theory and felt that children learned through a system of stimulus/response events.

Bio-ecological Theory

Urie Bronfenbrenner felt that environment shaped children's development and occurs on multiple layers, through the bio-ecological model.
Belief that development is affected by the environment which is thus constantly changing and redirecting development.
Anti-bias curriculum and many individualized assessment procedures have been greatly influenced by this theory.

Remember that theories are developed over time, and often will reflect the belief systems and values common to that society and time in history. Theories often will adjust when new scientific knowledge is gained, as in the understanding of how the brain develops.

Discussion post 1
This is one of the most important points made in the Belmont Report, which was established as a research-ethics policy in the 1970s after the public revelation of the Tuskegee syphilis study. The ethical worry is about can go wrong when people who think they are getting clinical care are actually research participants, or when people running a medical study treat it as though they're engaged in patient care. Blurring the key differences between the two can be dangerous and unethical. 
So...how, exactly? Let's brainstorm from the perspectives of the different parties involved:

Q1: For a participant/patient, how are things importantly different whether they are a participant in medical research vs. a patient receiving clinical care? 
Q2: For a researcher/clinician, how are things importantly different whether what they're doing is medical research vs. what they're doing is patient care? 

Discussion post 2
Before you read the articles for this week, what -- if anything -- had you ever heard about the Tuskegee syphilis study? What sorts of historical, medical, and ethical information about the Tuskegee study did you learn from our reading that caught your attention?

m1," Roughly speaking, a firm has increasing returns to scale if doubling all inputs leads to output increasing by more than a factor of two. Decreasing returns to scale is when doubling all of a firm's inputs, while likely increasing output, increases output by less than a factor of two. Whether returns to scale are increasing or decreasing often depends on how much room for increased specialization a firm has.

Here Are The Top Reasons Why Your Car's Engine Stalls While Driving,"When did you last experience panic? Definitely, it would be a close encounter on the road with an unsteady vehicle, or it could be the presence of an animal on the road. But, have you ever had an engine stall?
**What do you understand by ""car stalling""?**
Actually, ""stalling"" refers to a condition in which your car's running engine abruptly stops. However, there are always a number of warning lights when an engine stalls. It happens in two ways: either gradually, just like a driver would normally stop the engine, or with a sudden jerk.
Stalling can occur at any time, whether the engine is running or not. When an engine stalls, however, there is no power from the engine, and the power steering does not function. Sometimes, you cannot even use brakes.
Though, a car usually gets stalled in normal conditions when you usually use brakes without changing gears to lower slots or neutral. When a car stalls this way, it usually produces a jerk. Though the chances of seeing warning lights are less if a car stalls due to the driver’s mistake.
On the other hand, if a car stalls due to an internal issue, you can see the emergence of warning lights on your dashboard.  However, there might be a number of reasons behind the engine's sudden stalling.
In case, you are looking for a trusted [Car garage](https://servicemycar.com/uae/car-garage) to change an engine oil, we would like to suggest you Service My Car, the best and trusted car workshop in the town.
**A faulty fuel system may stall a car**
A fuel system failure may turn into a problem and cause a vehicle to stall. Fuel system issues, including the defective fuel pump and failure of fuel delivery due to obstruction in the fuel line, usually cause the engine to stop abruptly.
If there were any problems with the fuel delivery to the engine, the combustion would not happen properly.
**Malfunctioning electrical components may cause a car to stop abruptly**
Though batteries produce required current to start a vehicle, later the alternator provides adequate voltage for a number of operations of the engine and other necessary components.
But a malfunctioning alternator might lack the capacity to provide the required voltage. This also fails to recharge the battery. This might be causing a vehicle to have an issue with its engine, and it would be no surprise if a car stalls unexpectedly.
**Sensor failure may halt the engine's operations**
No doubt! A modern car’s engine only works based on the inputs of various sensors, such as the engine temperature sensor, the mass airflow sensor, etc. And, of course, any failure of the sensor's inputs causes problems in the various activities of the combustion process.
However, the ECU generally knows about a sensor fault, which it definitely indicates through warning lights.
If you notice any problem with your vehicle, take it to the nearest Service My Car workshop for a quick car scanning and diagnostics.
**A car’s engine timing is not synchronised**
Being a complex mechanism, there is always a need for various belts or chains to synchronise a number of components. However, there is always a probability of wear and tear on the timing belt or chain.
A car cannot manage the failure of the timing chain. Typically, a chain will lose one or more teeth, making engine operation difficult. Though it does not only cause the engine to stall, there is high probability of engine damage.
However, it would be better to be alert for any signs of a timing belt issue. An expert at Service My car can inspect it for a remedy or possible timing belt replacement.
**Cooling issues may wreak havoc under the hood**
Though most cars come with a robust cooling system, it usually does not get out of order very easily. But if it happens, the overheating may create a lot of problems under the hood.
There could be a lot of reasons for cooling system failure, such as coolant shortage due to leakage, lack of pressure due to a faulty pump, radiator or thermostat problems. Overheating can result in the engine stalling because the ECU monitors the temperature under the hood so closely.
However, a major concern is damage to the head gasket. Though maintaining the cooling system components is the best way to avoid overheating, if you have experienced any overheating incidents recently, visit Service My Car for an inspection and head gasket replacement.
**A critical component failure may stall your car**
A clutch, in a manual transmission, has the responsibility of managing the synchronisation of an engine and transmission. For automatic transmissions, a torque converter is used.
However, these components may be problematic when they sustain a lot of wear and tear. A slipping clutch, for example, does not help you with transmission or gear changes.
Besides, it could get stuck or seize, and you cannot even change the gear by pressing the pedal entirely. A car will stall if it has to run in a higher gear at low RPMs or when you apply rigorous brakes in a gear.
On the other hand, a problematic transmission system also causes a car’s engine to stall eventually. However, you can avoid critical component failure if there is a preventive mechanism. In a nutshell, never underestimate car maintenance.
When a car’s engine stalls, it would not be wise to waste time but rather take it to the nearest workshop of Service My Car as soon as possible. If you want to fix an appointment, just book a car service online or order a car repair order on our website or app.",Operations Management,,,

Criticism,"This assignment is something particular, you can find the discussion of week 2 attached in case you need it and the criteria discussed in that week are inside parentheses in the question. I also send you the rubric so that you can be guided by what you should do, I have been deducted points for not following the guidelines of the rubric. Thank you
Question: Using the criteria presented in week 2( Making judgement as to whether a theory could be adapted for use in research is very important.  Describe the internal and external criticism that is used to evaluate middle range theories.) , critique the theory of Self-Efficacy using the internal and external criticism evaluation process. 
Disccusion of week 2:Internal and external criticisms are essential when assessing middle-range theories for their adaptability and appropriateness for research by assessing the theoretical framework's logical coherence, empirical backing, and real-world significance through these criticisms.
When criticizing internally, the main focus is ensuring that a theory has logical consistency and internal coherence.  The assessment of the model involves analyzing its conceptual clarity and precision, logical connections between variables, and underlying theoretical suppositions (Risjord, 2019). One aspect of internal criticism is ensuring that theoretical propositions maintain internal validity by being logically sound and free from contradictions.   Scrutinizing conceptual definitions and logical implications of propositions along with internal structure is essential to detect any errors in logic or concept within a theory.
Assessing a theory's external validity and empirical support is what external criticism does. The examination evaluates the theory's effectiveness by testing its ability to apply to genuine conditions and explain or foresee events (Im, 2018). External criticism requires an assessment of a theory's empirical soundness, alignment with current knowledge, and capacity for creating testable predictions (Peterson et al., 2019). Researchers evaluate a theory by considering its consistency with past empirical research and its ability to account for various observations.   A lack of empirical backing or failure to account for critical empirical occurrences could make a theory less appropriate for research.
Internal and external criticisms are crucial for a complete evaluation of middle-range theories, as they are interdependent and indispensable.   The theory can be guaranteed to be logically consistent and internally valid by engaging in internal criticism. By subjecting theories to external critique, one can verify their empirical validity and relevance to practical situations (Peterson et al., 2019). Determining whether a theory can be adapted for research requires researchers to assess these aspects thoroughly. Inadequate internal coherence or external validity in theories may hinder the development of meaningful and applicable knowledge. To advance scientific understanding, researchers should choose theories with a solid foundation and a high likelihood of contribution.   A comprehensive evaluation process can help accomplish this task. ",Nursing,,,

During settlement discussions, the dentist tells you he wants you to use certain information he claims he gleaned from the patient while he was under the anesthetic during the root canal procedure concerning the patient’s marital infidelity.  The dentist believes if you make it known to the other attorney, the plaintiff will end his case because he is a public figure with much to lose if the infidelity were to become known.  You have serious concerns the dentist is lying to you about what this claim.

Introduction
Self-control is a personality trait. Self-control failure results in the inability to resist self-control failure, temptations, and impulses. It also leads to issues such as education, savings, retirement, and obesity (Duckworth et al., 2019). In this situation, individuals exhibit suboptimal behaviors. Low self-control is an aspect of personality observed by peculiarities such as smoking. (Baumeister and Heatherton,1996; Ariely and Wertenbroch,2002). Self-control in response is a trait, not a state that can change in duration (Uhr et al.,2021). From the early years, humans could suppress one urge in favor of a goal-oriented rival appetite (Eisenberg, Smith, & Spinrad, 2011). Willpower describes ""this straightforward, brute-force approach to doing what is in one's best interest when an alluring alternative beckon"" (Mahoney & Thoresen, 1972). Self-control failures can happen at any age, although the ability to control impulses improves through adolescence and early adulthood (De Luca et al., 2003; Baumeister, Heatherton, and Tice, 1994). In economics, it was introduced through the dual-self model and self-controlled planner. According to this model, these models usually coexist in a conflicted state in the individual (Thaler and Shefrin,1981). Self-control explains undersaving and non-participation decisions (Uhr et al.,2021). The intent is to show that Self-control and self-control-failure determine the individual's financial beliefs and overall habits.
Current trends
People who practice self-control have healthier and wealthier lives. Self-control involves habits such as exercising, forgoing dessert, to saving for retirement. There is an ongoing battle going on among individuals. (Duckworth et al.,2018). Temptations and rewards often interfere with people setting long-term goals and trading them for short-term ones. It does not help that everything is so convenient for consumers ( Akst, 2011).In addition, self-control does not matter if people are mistaken about the advantages and disadvantages of their choices (Duckworth et al., 2018).
Self-control failure can cause factors such as overtrading. Self-control failure remains high regarding trading activity and the same for overconfidence, sensation seeking, attention-grabbing, gambling preferences, and other social contagions. Smokers, in addition, have more months with trades and higher trading values that they buy or sell (Uhr et al., 2021).In regard to savings, more smokers sought a savings device or plan. However, they did not maintain these plans (Uhr et al.,2021). Distortions often occur in these cases. In financial markets, savings distortions generate asset price distortions.
Moreover, disagreements affect aggregate investments. The investment levels should be reasonable, not unreasonable or distorted. The planner should have the ability to identify correct beliefs. However, there is a concept of distortion that respects a person's idea that determines an outcome is only viewed as distorted if all agents agree (Heyerdahl-Larsen and Walden,2022).
Undersaving or oversaving is also a problem regarding self-control and self-control failure. For example, the U.S. and China have a global account imbalance. This is what triggered the trade war between the two countries. The savings excess in China has caused a decrease in long-term interest rates and housing bubbles. The results of overspending in the U.S. can be easily seen. Decreasing discount rates help to explain how the young tend to undersave while those near retirement age oversave (Kureishi et al., 2021). So what can be done about these situations? Regarding the U. S. and China, it is recommended that restraining housing bubbles and interest rates is the solution, as well as replacing the U.S. dollar with a new world currency (Wan, 2021). Regarding other factors, it is suggested that psychological guidelines are implemented in the Economy to reduce self-control failures such as self-deployed and cognitive intervention (Duckworth et al.,2018).
Future trends
Future trends are essential to determine what direction a topic is progressing. There needs to be research that compares interventions from diverse traditions. The comparability to meta-analyses is another factor to explore, as well as comparisons of efficacy, scalability, and costs of different approaches to lessening self-control failures. Little is known about how interventions complement or substitute each other. More research is needed on how to gain the development of an executive function. Finally, the robustness, adequate size, and cost of interventions in review must be explored (Duckworth et al., 2018).
Studies in household finance could be a future study, and guidelines for restraining housing bubbles and interest rates could be explored(Kureishi et al.,2021; Wan, 2021). In addition, there could be future trading and investment exploration (Uhr et al., 2021). Moreover,guidelines regarding financial education, information sharing, and announcements could be a future exploration(Heyerdahl-Larsen and Walden,2022).

Illegal immigration, for example, has been going on for many years, but it was not until the 1990s that enough people considered it such a serious problem that it required increased government action. Another example is crime. American society tolerates a certain level of crime; however, when crime rises dramatically or is perceived to be rising dramatically, it becomes an issue for policymakers to address.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Screening
Screening plays an essential role in healthcare by identifying individuals with a particular condition. It involves administering tests or measures to differentiate those who likely have the condition from those who probably do not. While screening offers several advantages, it also presents certain disadvantages. This discussion explores the benefits and drawbacks of screening in healthcare.
Advantages of Screening
One of the primary advantages of screening is the ability for early detection of illnesses or conditions. Early identification permits well-timed interventions, leading to better treatment results and advanced prognosis. For example, mammography screening can detect breast cancer early, increasing the possibilities of successful treatment and survival. Secondly, screening can lead to implementing preventive measures that can reduce the risk or progression of a condition (Givler & Givler, 2023). For example, screening for high blood pressure can identify humans with excessive blood pressure, allowing healthcare providers to prescribe a way of life modifications and drugs to prevent complications like coronary heart disease and stroke. Lastly, screening packages can extensively affect public health by identifying people in danger within a population. Through targeting specific conditions, which include infectious illnesses, screening can assist in containing outbreaks, reduce transmission, and enhance population health.
Disadvantages of Screening
Firstly, screening tests are imperfect and can produce false positives and negatives. False positives occur while a test suggests the presence of a condition when none exists, leading to unnecessary tension and follow-up investigations. False negatives, alternatively, can deliver individuals a false experience of security, leading to behind-schedule analysis and treatment. Also, Screening can identify conditions that may never have caused harm or required treatment (Yong et al., 2022). This phenomenon, known as over diagnosis, can lead to unnecessary medical interventions, including surgeries, medications, and associated risks and costs. Lastly, screening programs require significant resources in terms of finances, healthcare personnel, and infrastructure. This can strain healthcare systems, especially in resource-limited settings, where allocating resources for screening might take away from other essential healthcare services.
In conclusion, screening provides several advantages by enabling early detection, facilitating preventive measures, and impacting public health positively. However, it also presents certain disadvantages, including the potential for false positives and negatives, over diagnosis, and resource utilization. Therefore, carefully considering the benefits and drawbacks is necessary when implementing screening programs, ensuring that the benefits outweigh the potential harms.",Nursing,Nurs,,
REPLY TO A DISCUSSION," 
Introduction
Screening is a significant device in healthcare, planning to recognize people in danger of specific circumstances or sicknesses before side effects appear. It includes utilizing tests to recognize early signs, empowering brief intercessions, and further developing results. Screening programs have been carried out for different regions, like a malignant growth, cardiovascular illnesses, and many other illnesses, fully intent on lessening grimness and death rates (Aitken & et al., 2019). In any case, the advantages and impediments of screening should be painstakingly thought of. This discussion inspects the advantages and disadvantages of well-being advancement and infection counteraction through screening, revealing insight into possible advantages and difficulties.
Advantages Of Screening
Early Identification
 One of the essential advantages of screening is the potential for early discovery of infections. By recognizing conditions in their beginning phases, treatment can start sooner, frequently prompting improved results and expanded possibilities of full recovery. For example, Mammograms is known as one of the best techniques to detect early breast cancer , while HPV test and Pap test have successfully distinguished in early detection of cervical malignancy at the beginning phase (Yip, et al., 2021).
Avoidance and Intercession
Screening programs can assist with forestalling the advancement of specific infections or conditions. For instance, through normal circulatory strain screenings, people with hypertension can be recognized and given formal mediations, like way-of-life adjustments or medicine, to forestall further confusions like coronary illness or stroke.
General Well-being Effect
 Screening can fundamentally affect general well-being. By distinguishing people in danger and executing appropriate measures, for example, segregation or treatment, the spread of sicknesses can be checked. This effect is clear in programs, for example, HIV screening, which has helped control the transmission of the infection (C. M. Van der Aalst & et al., 2019).
Disadvantages Of Screening: Bogus Up-sides and Negatives
 Screening tests are not secure and can create misleading outcomes. Misleading up-sides happen when the test demonstrates the presence of a condition. However, further indicative tests uncover that the individual is substantial. Bogus negatives, then again, occur when the test neglects to distinguish a state, prompting a missed conclusion. These mistaken outcomes can cause pointless tension or give a misguided feeling that everything is okay.
Overdiagnosis and Overtreatment
 Screening can prompt overdiagnosis, which happens when a condition is distinguished that couldn't have ever caused side effects or mischief during an individual's lifetime. Overdiagnosis can bring superfluous clinical intercessions, for example, medical procedures or prescriptions, which can worry about their dangers and concerns.
Cost and Asset Designation
Screening programs can be costly, particularly for a huge scope. Designating assets to far and broad screening endeavors can redirect assets from different areas of medical care, possibly influencing admittance to fundamental administrations or therapy for the people who need it most. It is pivotal to assess the expense viability of screening programs to guarantee ideal asset usage painstakingly.
Mental Effect
 Screening can mentally affect people, especially when misleading up-sides happen, or people get a positive determination. The nervousness, stress, and profound weight related to screening results can fundamentally influence an individual's psychological wealth.
Conclusion

Screening programs enjoy benefits like early recognition and work on wealth. However, they additionally have disadvantages. Issues incorporate bogus outcomes, overdiagnosis, asset portion, and mental effects. Finding harmony among advantages and downsides is vital, guaranteeing proof-based, very much arranged programs with sufficient direction and backing for people going through screening.",Nursing,NURSE ,,

Case Study 2," 
In the case of Coca-Cola Co. v. Koke Co. of America, the Coca-Cola Co. sought to enjoin The Koke Co. of America and other beverage companies from, among other things, using the word Koke for their products.  Koke contended that the Coca-Cola trademark was a fraudulent representation and that Coca-Cola was thus not entitled to an injunction.  Koke alleged that Coca-Cola, by its use of the Coca-Cola name, represented that the beverage contained cocaine (from coca leaves).  The court granted the injunction against Koke, but an appellate court reversed.  Coca-Cola appealed to the United States Supreme Court.
The United States Supreme Court upheld the trial court's decision.  The Supreme Court acknowledged that before 1900 Coca-Cola's good will was enhanced by the presence of a small amount of cocaine, but that the cocaine had long been eliminated from the drink.  The Court underscored that Coca-Cola was not ""a medicine"" and that its attraction did not lay in producing ""a toxic effect.""  Since 1900 sales had increased.  The name had come to characterize a well known beverage to be had almost anywhere ""rather than a compound of particular substances.""  The Court noted that before this suit was brought Coca-Cola had advertised that the public would not find cocaine in Coca-Cola.  ""[I]t would be going too far to deny the plaintiff relief against a palpable fraud because possibly here and there are ignorant person might call for the drink with the hope for incipient cocaine intoxication.""

ethics discussion post 3,"Leonard Fleck and Marcia Angell each offer answers (and arguments to support these answers) to the main question posed: ""Would Carlos's physician be morally justified in breaching confidentiality on the grounds that he had a 'duty to warn'?""
Now that you've had some time to ruminate over the medical and moral challenges of this case, and to critically reflect on the commentaries from Fleck and Angell, which of them do you think gives the better answer, and why? (And if you find yourself dissatisfied with both of them, you can say that too...)

In her short article, Sarah Breier-Mackie identifies several differences she sees between the main priorities of nursing ethics and the main priorities of physician-centered ethics. 
What do you think -- does the way Breier-Mackie writes about nurses, nursing ethics, and nurses' relationships to their patients resonate with you? (If you yourself have experience as a nursing (or a CNA, or another position in healthcare) this would be a great place to draw on your professional experience. But even for the rest of us, we can reflect on our experiences as patients (and as parents / family members) with nurses, doctors, and other healthcare professionals.)

Why so Howard Brody and other medical ethicists take the time to discuss what counts as truly informed consent in clinical contexts? For one thing, it's because we know that someone signing a form might legally count, but ethically, just signing a form at a doctor's office can fall far short genuinely understanding and consenting to a procedure. 
So let's brainstorm a bit -- keeping things anonymous, but grounded in real-life cases. Can you share with us a time when a patient's consent has fallen short of constituting truly informed consent?",Applied Sciences,medical,ethics,

Assignment Details
As children, people are taught right from wrong. As they grow more mature, they understand that there are professions where some leeway is allowed. Killing is generally considered immoral and anathema to society, but police officers are sometimes called upon to kill those who break the law or threaten others in society.
Police officers are often given deference when their actions cause harm due to faulty information. There are arguments that despite this deference, consequences should follow. Consider the potential consequences if a community chooses to control the reckless use of authority.
Address the following questions:

What should be some of the consequences for law enforcement for providing inaccurate information?
How would you address the issue of officers who act as a law unto themselves?

Discussion forum: In my psych nursing practice, I found significant patient readmission rates in a specific patient category, specifically those with major depressive disorder (MDD). The scenario identifies readmission factors and implements interventions to enhance patient outcomes.
Demographic data, medical history, medication records, treatment plans, therapy session notes, and patient feedback questionnaires could solve this problem. This data can be collected from EHRs, patient interviews, staff observations, and standardized evaluation tools (Howell et al., 2023). Secure EHR systems or databases enable data access.
To effectively address the problem of high readmission rates in patients with MDD, the nurse leader must evaluate data to solve MDD patients' high readmission rates. The nurse leader can determine if age, gender, or socioeconomic status are linked to more excellent readmission rates by evaluating demographic data. According to Magny-Normilus et al. (2019), medical history and medication records can show treatment patterns, medication adherence, and potential comorbidities that may lead to readmissions. Treatment plans and session notes can reveal MDD interventions and their efficacy. Patient feedback surveys can reveal the patient's experience, care satisfaction, and treatment effectiveness hurdles.
Analyzing readmission data may show triggers, non-adherence to treatment plans, lack of social support, or poor medication administration. For instance, patients with significant life pressures like a recent loss or financial issues may be readmitted more often. The results may also show that patients without taking their medications or having poor social support are more likely to be readmitted. This understanding can help nurse leaders create targeted interventions for these situations.
Based on the derived knowledge, clinical reasoning and judgment allow nurse leaders to create evidence-based initiatives. They prioritized interventions and allocated resources based on each patient's needs. If data shows that medication non-adherence is a significant cause of readmissions, the nurse leader may focus on patient and family education. They may work with the pharmacist to simplify drug regimens or provide reminders. Clinical reasoning and judgment also include continual intervention assessment and evaluation (Manetti, 2019). The nurse leader would monitor and analyze data to assess intervention efficacy and make modifications. If educational efforts fail to improve medication adherence, the nurse leader may consider home visits by nurses to help patients manage their medications.
The nurse leader can also evaluate confounding factors and interpret data in the context of the patient group through the use of their clinical expertise and experience. They would recognize the complexity of mental health problems like MDD and that systemic concerns like poor follow-up care or community support service gaps may cause readmissions. The nurse leader can advocate for systemic changes and work with community resources to address these underlying causes with this comprehensive approach.

Overview
We have spent several weeks seeing the world through other eyes and examining imbalances of power and privilege and the inequitable access to resources that imbalance creates. During those same weeks we have been examining ourselves and what role our personal experiences play in how we interact with the people in the world around us. During our reflexive work, we examined our worldview and potentially grew and will continue to grow in positive ways because of it.

Sample annotation paragraph 
The article examines the meaning of the word ‘care’ within a nursing context. The responsibility of nurses to provide care is legitimized in numerous documents, and the author goes on to identify key concepts related to nursing care.
In particular, these concepts include assisting, helping and giving a service; offering this service to people who need help with daily living activities and to others who are affected by health deviations or illness of some kind.
Moreover, the nurse’s caring role is legitimized by the patients. Finally, the article concludes by relating how these concepts are put into operation by using the steps of the nursing process—assessing, planning, implementing and evaluating the patient’s need for nursing care. The main limitation of the article is that all of the research was exclusively conducted in large city hospitals.
Therefore, while the article is useful for an analysis of nursing care, the limitations of its research base will require some adaption to meet the needs of this assignment that requires a commentary on services in both city and country area hospitals.

Signature Assignment 2: Twelve-15 slide PowerPoint Presentation and report– Early and Middle Child Development (100 points)

The purpose of this assignment is to allow you to synthesize your new knowledge and extend your learning by discussing theories related to child development, birth defects, and language acquisition.

For this Signature Assignment, you will need to construct a 12-15 slide PowerPoint presentation with an introduction and references explaining what you have learned about early and middle childhood development from at least eight different resources. Begin by discussing Kohlberg’s stages of moral development. Next, explain the role of play in child development and Piaget’s preoperational stage. Then discuss activities to support learning. Use the notes section in the PowerPoint presentation to add narrative content you would typically speak as you show your presentation (a good presentation is more than just reading what you wrote on the slides!) As you construct your presentation, consider the layout, use of fonts, text, and color while using accurate language and mechanics. Your five references should be listed on a Works Cited slide in MLA format.

2 responses DB: African Empires  ,"1.  
The main feature of Ghana is the fact that Ghana, literally sat on a gold mine. The land's abundance of resources allowed Ghana's rulers to engage in years of prosperous trading. Strategic governing coupled with great location led to the rapid emergence of a very wealthy empire. Most of what we know about ancient Ghana- which is more accurately called Wagadugu- is based on writings of Arab travelers who came in contact with the nation's people. Evidence of Ghana's occupation dates back to the 4th century, but it was several hundred years later that it became established as a nation by a tribe known as the Soninke, whose leaders have been credited with the early strengthening of the Wagadugu state and the expansion of its territories. The nation had undergone strategic expansion of its territories.
The structure of the society of Ghana allowed Ghana to become powerful and impotant to history. When the king was not busy enforcing his power among the people, he was spreading it internationally through trade. Ghana was cheifly bartering gold,ivory, and slaves for salt from Arabs and horses, cloth, swords, and books from North Africans and Europeans. As salt was worth its weight in gold, and gold was so abundant in the kingdom, Ghana acheived much of its wealth through trade with the Arabs. Islamic merchants traveled  over two months through the desert to reach Ghana and ""do business"". With this system, it is no wonder that Ghana got rich quickly. The Ghana Empire grew rich from the increased trans-Saharan trade in gold, slaves and salt, allowing for larger urban centers to develope.

The Civilization I chose to write about is the Axum empire. It was established in the last year 100 C.E. Axum created its own port which brought it into the international trade light. Axum started to rise due its conversion to Christianity, but prior to that, it was great until the eighth century. After that, it died down and was left abandoned. In the sixth century, the Prophet Muhammad was born, and they had a resurgence. It crossed the Red Sea and conquered southwestern Arabia. After driving out the last holdout of Christianity believers, they were not again.
                The Axum empire thrived off farming and irrigation. They did this on the hilly slopes of the mountains that surrounded them. It helped them maximize the land around them and make their empire more productive. While Axum was sefl sufficient, they became an empire that later on in their rule almost completely relied on exportation of goods. Axum still exists to this day. Although it is not as large as it was in its zenith, it has an estimated population of 50,000. Additionally, Greek was commonly used language. Axum is also one of the few empires that did not build pyramids.",History,Prof,,

Sexual assault: This is an act in which one intentionally sexually touches another person without the person’s consent, or coerces or physically forces a person to engage in a sexual act against their will. Such as oral sex or penetrating the perpetrator’s body. There are 3 elements of sexual assault which are the use of a weapon, the use of physical strength or violence as is sufficient to overcome, restrain, or injure a person and finally inflicting physical harm sufficient enough to coerce or compel submission by the victim. Such crimes can result in 20 years max if found guilty.
Locally and nationally, there are 24-hour crisis centers spread out through communities and a local 24-hour hotline available for victims of sexual abuse.
Some areas that are lacking are not believing someone when they say they were sexually assaulted because there was little to no evidence or judging someone by their race and past.
Child abuse: Is any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse exploitation, or an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm. Child abuse is not always intentional it could be an accident, but you failed as a parent and now you are being punished. Most children that are abused won’t speak up because they are either scared that no one will believe them or scared of being taken away from the only person they thought loved them.  ",Human Resource Management,pro,,

Overview
As we implement several positive teaching strategies, we can prevent and diffuse challenging and unsocial behaviors. We model how children can behave to move them toward self-regulation. We celebrate their accomplishments and exercise patience as they move through this process at their rate. In determining which strategy will be most effective for an individual child or group of children in a particular situation, educators first need to meet young children at their development and then challenge them to reach achievable learning goals.
The 10 Positive Teaching Strategies espoused by NAEYC can help guide decision making in this area.

Experimental Analysis ," 
The highest level of scientific investigation demonstrated in the FBA is the experimental analysis. The experimental analysis exemplifies the rigor of control as the practitioner manipulates environmental variables to evoke and abate the problem behavior. The consistent control of evoking and abating the target behavior demonstrates the functional relationship between environmental variable(s) and the target behavior(s).
For this assignment, select an experimental analysis of problem behaviors such as the Iwata’s full functional analysis (FA), brief FA, latency-based FA, trial-based FA, precursor FA, or the IISCA. Provide the benefits and limitations of the selected experimental analysis. Describe the conditions of your experiment to test the hypothesized function(s) or contingencies influencing the behaviors of concern. Provide hypothetical data and a visual display (graph). Be sure to incorporate values of compassion and cultural humility when selecting and conducting the experimental analysis. You can refer to the Capella Compassion Code [DOCX] for more details.
Part 1: Select the Experimental Analysis
Select the experimental analysis to be conducted for your functional behavior assessment. Provide the benefits and limitations of the selected experimental analysis. Provide a rationale for why you have chosen this method for the person or character you chose in your first assignment. Please include in your rationale how you considered compassionate approaches when selecting your experimental analysis.
Part 2: Describe the Experimental Analysis
Describe the conditions and procedures of your experimental analysis. Be sure to program for the appropriate establishing operations as suspected from the descriptive assessment. Please include in your rationale how you considered compassionate approaches when conducting your experimental analysis.
Part 3: Display Hypothetical Data and Interpret Results
For ethical reasons, DO NOT conduct an actual experimental analysis of behavior for this assignment. Instead, generate hypothetical data to show outcomes you might expect if you were to conduct the experimental analysis. Present the hypothetical data and result of the experimental analysis in a visual display. Be sure to use an appropriate graph to display the data, demonstrating experimental control. Interpret the results.
Part 4: Conclude the Experimental Analysis
Conclude the results of the experimental analysis by providing a confirmation of the functional control between environmental variables and problem behaviors. In other words, confirm the function(s) influencing problem behaviors. For the IISCA, confirm the functional control between the synthesized contingencies and problem behaviors.
Additional Requirements
Your assignment should meet the following requirements:

Written communication: Should be free of errors that detract from the overall message.
APA formatting: References and citations are formatted according to current APA style guidelines. Review Evidence and APA for more information on how to cite your sources.

Intellectual disability (or ID) is a term used when a person has certain limitations in cognitive functioning and skills, including conceptual, social and practical skills, such as language, social and self-care skills. These limitations can cause a person to develop and learn more slowly or differently than a typically developing person. Intellectual disability can happen any time before a person turns 22 years old, even before birth.
Intellectual disability is the most common developmental disability.
According to the American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, an individual has intellectual disability if he or she meets three criteria:

IQ is below 70.
There are significant limitations in adaptive behavior in one or more of the following areas: conceptual, social or practical skills (skills that are needed to live, work, and play in the community).
The condition manifests itself before the age of 22.

An intellectual disability is not the same as a learning disability. An intellectual disability refers to when somebody has a developmental disorder (ie. autism), whereas a learning disability refers to when a person has difficulty learning in specific academic areas (ie. dyslexia).
Strategies for ID

Using small steps. ...
Modify teaching to be more hands-on. ...
Think visual. ...
Use baby steps. ...
Incorporate more physical learning experiences. ...
Start a feedback book or chart. ...
Encourage music in the classroom.

Process Improvement Plan,"Develop a 5-7-page process improvement plan for a provided scenario or a business and process of your choice, using data to support your recommendations.
Introduction
This portfolio work project, a process improvement plan, will help you demonstrate competencies in process documentation, process analysis, and process improvement.
Scenario
For this assessment, choose either Option 1 or Option 2. You do not need to do both. You will apply one of these scenarios in the Requirements below. Both options will be graded using the same scoring guide.
Option 1
Wild Dog Coffee Company, a locally owned company with a single coffee shop location, serves a wide selection of espresso products, small breakfast and lunch menu items, and a limited evening menu. The company is planning to expand the business by adding an additional location. While different menu items may be tested at the new location, the espresso beverage preparation process will remain exactly the same. The company wants to ensure that the espresso beverage preparation process is documented and refined before the move.
Option 2
Select a business and process of your choosing. Note: It is recommended that you use the same business for each assessment in this course. Before choosing a company, read all three of the assessments thoroughly to ensure the following:

The company fits the assessment requirements and you have access to the information needed to complete the assessment.
The business information is disclosed in the assessment for faculty's reference.
You can distribute the business data without disclosing confidential information.

Contact faculty with questions.
Your Role
Option 1
You are one of three owners of Wild Dog Coffee Company. Your background is primarily in operations. Your business partners' backgrounds are in marketing and sales. While they are working on the external aspects of the business that will bring customers in, you are focused on making the internal customer-facing processes as efficient as possible. You are preparing an analysis and recommendations that will help manage a core process improvement for the successful opening of a second location.
Option 2
Your boss, a director, has tasked you with a process improvement project. She is relying on you to prepare an analysis and recommendations that can be presented to the executive team of the company.
Requirements
Include the following in your process improvement plan:

Assess the steps for a selected process.
    
Develop a flowchart showing the process' steps. You may include as many steps as are relevant for your selected scenario.
If using Wild Dog Coffee Company, show the steps for preparing an espresso beverage (for example, latté, cappuccino); there are two steps that must be included: (1) order is submitted and (2) beverage is handed to the customer. Hint: You may want to visit a local coffee shop to observe the beverage preparation process.


Prepare a procedure documenting the selected process. At a minimum, the procedure must document the following for your selected process:
    
Metrics. Identify at least two metrics that will be useful in determining how well the new process is performing. Be sure to identify the target value of the metric and how you will measure it.
        
For Wild Dog Coffee Company, it could be how well the beverage preparation process is performing. A third metric is already identified for you: order delivery time. (This is the time between when the order is submitted and the time the beverage is handed to the customer.)


Procedure. This section describes each step of the process.
        
For Wild Dog Coffee Company, your procedure should be titled, “Espresso Beverage Preparation Process.” Be sure to include order submittal and handing the beverage to the customer as part of the procedure.


Purpose (of the procedure). This section describes what the procedure is intended to do.


Analyze data for process changes for a selected process. Respond to the following questions:
    
Is the process centered? Provide the results of your calculations and the rationale for your decision by thinking about the process capability.
Is the process capable at 3-sigma? Provide the results of your calculations and the rationale for your decision by thinking about the process capability index.
Is the process in statistical control? Provide the appropriate numbers and the rationale for your decision using a control chart for individuals.
For Wild Dog Coffee Company, analyze the Beverage Service Times [XLSX] data. This data is for 50 beverage preparation events and was collected using their order processing system. Each individual order gets a time-stamp when it is placed and again when the beverage is handed to the customer. The senior barista thinks the beverage delivery times should range between 2 and 3 minutes. The known process standard deviation, which has been calculated on an on-going basis, is 0.5903 minutes.


Analyze the cause and effect of process variances.
    
Brainstorm possible sources of variation to create a cause-and-effect diagram to help analyze potential sources of variation in the espresso beverage preparation process at Wild Dog Coffee Company or for your selected business' process. Your diagram must include at least four of the “6 Ms” (that is, management, manpower, method, measurement, machine, materials).


Recommend quality and customer service improvements for a selected process.
    
Detail the results of your analysis for Wild Dog Coffee Company or your selected business' process to substantiate your recommendations.



Deliverable Format
Requirements:

The process improvement plan is to be a minimum of 7 pages, not including the title, reference, and appendix pages.
Use a process improvement plan template of your choice.

Related company standards:

The process improvement plan is a professional document and should therefore follow the corresponding MBA Academic and Professional Document Guidelines (available in the MBA Program Resources), including single-spaced paragraphs.
In addition to the title and reference pages, include the following in the appendix:

Procedure.
Detailed results of order delivery time analysis.
Cause-and-effect diagram.


Use American Society for Quality (ASQ) data analysis tools and 2-3 additional scholarly or academic sources where applicable.
Use APA formatting for citations and references.

Evaluation
By successfully completing this assessment, you will demonstrate your proficiency in the following course competencies through corresponding scoring guide criteria:

Competency 1: Analyze how operations management theories and models effect the development and delivery of products or services to the marketplace.
    
Assess the steps for a selected process.

Designing a Survey," 
Try designing a brief self-report measure!
Here are the steps: 
1. Define a variable you would like to measure. For example, you can measure how much people love camping, people's opinions about AI, etc.
2. Design a short (3 item) self-report survey to assess that variable.
3. Turn in a document outlining your variable, a definition of that variable, and your short survey.
You will be graded on how well your questions capture your variable of interest as well as the extent to which you incorporate one or more concepts from Module 3 Part 1 reading on constructing survey questions (""Survey Research""
Actions reading).
Effective questions are “brief,” “relevant,” “unambiguous,” “specific,” and “objective.” Furthermore, you should think about the order of your 3-items, if certain questions could influence subsequent answers place those questions later in the survey.
Note: you do NOT need an ""Introduction"" or instructions for your survey, please just list your 3 items immediately after the variable definition.",Psychology,good work,on time ,
Scale Evaluation," 
You should have taken the data survey for our class project already (if you have not, please do so before you do this assignment: ).
Our survey contained a number of scales within it and we use scores on those to draw conclusions about the people within our sample. Your task for this assignment is to learn about one of those scales. You can find the PDFs for all of the scales at the bottom of the page. Please pick a scale that sounds interesting to you. For that scale please report the following:

What is the scales's name?
What is the scale trying to measure?
Does it have any subscales?
What kind of sample was it validated on? (if multiple studies were used in the paper, pick the most interesting one)
What is the reliability of the scale (either test-retest or Chronbach's alpha)? 

If you can't answer any of these questions, please indicate what information is missing to allow you to answer the question. 
This is an easy way to see some details about measures and begin to get ideas about your Paper 1. How might these various constructs relate to each other? Would you expect a gender difference? Would age matter?

In this work, you will make two contrasting normative arguments about what one ought to do. Both arguments will be about the same topic; thus, at least one of the arguments will contradict your personal opinion. You will compose the arguments in standard form, as a series of statements that end with your conclusion. Do not write your arguments as an ess







Step 1: Choose a Topic
Choose one topic from the following list:

Should people eat meat?
Should marijuana be legal?
Should pet cats be kept indoors?
Should zoos exist?
Should customers leave a tip in a coffee shop?
Should seat belt wearing be mandatory?
Should children be required to take gym/physical education?
Should public roads be used for private car parking?

Step 2. Develop Logically Contradictory Normative Conclusions
Develop two logically contradictory normative conclusions on this topic. You do not need to agree with both (or either!) conclusions, but you should be able to logically support both of them.
The conclusions need not be phrased exactly the same as they are phrased in the topic list, but they do need to be logically contradictory to one another.
EXAMPLE
If you selected the topic ""Should people eat meat?"", your conclusions might be:

People should not eat meat.
People should eat meat.

But it would also be acceptable to choose:

People should reduce their meat consumption.
People need not reduce their meat consumption.

Another option could be:

It is morally permissible to eat fish.
It is not morally permissible to eat fish.

Note that you need not indicate which conclusion you actually agree with. An omnivore might write an excellent logical argument for veganism, or vice versa!
Step 3: Write Normative Argument for First Conclusion
Choose your first conclusion and write a normative argument in standard form to reach that conclusion. This requires knowledge of the standard form of logical arguments, which you can find in 2.1.1 What Is an Argument?, and understanding of normative arguments, which you can find in 2.1.2 Identifying Arguments and Statements. Because normative arguments rely on standards of human behavior, you should also review 4.3.3 Moral Frameworks. The directions in the template will give you further instructions.
Step 4: Write Normative Argument for Second Conclusion
Repeat Step 3 for your second conclusion.
Here is an example of two arguments with normative conclusions taking contrary points of view. The normative premises are marked with an asterisk. This serves as an example of what arguments look like in standard form. This topic may not be used for your own Touchstone.

Americans are granted the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as a foundational principle of its founding documents.
Among these rights are bodily autonomy and personal decisions about family planning.*
Forcing a parent to go through an unwanted pregnancy and childbirth violates these principles by taking away their basic right to liberty and long-term pursuit of happiness.*
Forcing a parent to go through an unwanted pregnancy and childbirth also frequently presents a threat to the life of the birth parent.
There is no constitutional or scientific reason to confer personhood on a fetus.
Any opinion on the personhood of fetuses is thus not based on law or science, but a personal moral or religious choice.
The Constitution (Amendment 1) establishes the freedom of religion.
Therefore, any law derived from a religious stance is unconstitutional (from 5-7).
Therefore, pregnant people have the right to terminate a pregnancy for any reason (from 1-4, 8).
It is wrong to kill a human being without justification such as self-defense.*
An unplanned pregnancy may be inconvenient, but only in rare cases does it present a threat to a person’s life.
In no other cases besides abortion do we make it legal to murder people who inconvenience us.
Born children are also inconvenient, but it is not legal for parents to kill them.
In no other cases besides abortion do we make it legal to murder the born children of rape or incest.
A fetus is a viable human being at 24 weeks.
Therefore, except in cases where the pregnancy presents a threat to the birth parent’s life, abortion should be illegal after 24 weeks.

Step 5: Reflection
Answer the reflection questions about your reasoning behind the arguments you wrote. One question asks to identify a deductive rule of inference or an inductive practice used in your arguments. You can find these in 3.3.2 Valid Rules of Inference From Conditional Statements, 3.3.3 Valid Rules of Inference From Conjunction and Disjunction, and the 4.1.4 Inference to the Best Explanation, or other inductive practices discussed throughout unit 4.
Refer to the checklist below throughout the Touchstone process. Do not submit your Touchstone until it meets these guidelines.
1. Argument Preparation

❒ Is each argument in standard form, not paragraph form?
❒ Do your two arguments have logically contradictory conclusions?
❒ Is each argument at least seven declarative sentences, ending in a conclusion?
❒ Does each argument have a normative conclusion (saying what people ought to do)?
❒ Is there at least one normative premise that supports each conclusion?

2. Annotating Your Argument

❒ Did you place an asterisk (*) on the normative premise(s) that support your conclusion?
❒ Did you underline any subconclusions in your argument?
❒ Are there sources for any assertions that are fact-based and not well known/accepted?

3. Reflection Questions

❒ Did you answer all five of the reflection questions satisfactorily?
❒ Do your answers meet the length requirement and fully answer the question?

Nursing NUR 400 - Week 10 Consort Assignment,"Step 1. Critical:  all else depends on your finding a Randomized Controlled (Clinical) Trial Peer-Reviewed Journal Article (Level II Evidence)  Review Figure 1.1,~ p. 13 of your textbook for the Level of Evidence Pyramid, which shows an RCT is at Level II. When you communicate with physicians about an article, they respect the article more when it is at least on the Level II evidence pyramid, which suggests more credibility and possibly better input regarding outcomes of care.  Find your peer-reviewed Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) article related to your area of interest.
Step 2.  Once you have your article, read it, and then look at the CONSORT Checklist, and write the page number in the article that has the information the checklist requires. (FYI, researchers who publish their research use this checklist to be sure they have everything in their article, or it is often not accepted by premier scholarly publishers). The checklist is worth 25 points, as it takes time and discernment to do it correctly.

MSW Program Outcomes

Prepare students to be ethical social work practitioners who make sound professional judgments, across various levels of specialized practice, and advance lives of children, families, communities, and groups domestically and abroad.
Prepare students to be caring, self-reflective advocates for those who are oppressed, marginalized, disenfranchised, and without a voice to advocate for themselves.
Engage faculty and students in research that informs practice and policy and expands the knowledge base of the profession.
Create and deliver models for outstanding inter-professional education and collaborative practice to enhance the well-being of individuals, families, groups, and communities. 
Prepare competent, informed students to engage in specialized social work practice with individuals, families, groups, communities, and organizations. 

MSW Practicum Requirements
Field Education is the signature pedagogy of the social work profession-- the primary method used to guide students in becoming competent practitioners. At Chamberlain, we provide two types of experience to help students master social work competencies—the Immersion Experience and the Field Practicum. At this point in the MSW journey, students will have successfully completed the Immersion Experience.
The Field Practicum provides a hands-on opportunity to apply the skills learned in coursework in an actual social work setting.  As a Traditional Two-Year student, he/she will complete a total of 1000 hours between two field practicums--Foundation Field Practicum in year 1 and Advanced Practicum in year 2.  As an Advanced Standing student, he/she will complete a total of 500 hours in Advanced Practicum, during their one year in the program.
The Advanced Field practicum is connected to MSW 550 – Advanced Practicum I and MSW 551 –Advanced Practicum II, which provides additional support through the course instructor, the Field Liaison. During the field practicum, the Field Liaison will be the first point of contact to guide students through their learning, alongside the on-site supervisor, the Field Instructor, who holds an MSW and is responsible for the student’s learning.   In addition, some students may also have an on-site Task Supervisor, depending upon the structure of the agency, who will be involved with supervising the student as well. 
Student Learning Agreement 
The Learning Agreement reflects the tasks and activities, per each behavior, that students will complete during the practicum.  Students’ professional goals and interests should be considered and incorporated as best as possible, given the agency’s capacity. Students will be evaluated based on their competency in each behavior, as aligned with the activities outlined below. The evaluation process should be a collaborative and reflective one between the student and Field Instructor.  The Field Instructor has the final decision all evaluation scores.
The Learning Agreement is an assignment in the MSW 550 – Advanced Practicum I and MSW 551 – Advanced Practicum II courses.  Please complete this form in consultation with your Field Instructor and submit via Canvas for review by your Field Liaison, by the due date outlined in the course.  


Social Work Competencies, Behaviors, & Student Activities:
Students, in consultation with their Field Instructors, must develop specific activities for the student to complete, for each behavior of the CSWE Social Work Competencies, and relevant behaviors.   It is required that each behavior have a corresponding task or activity.  A task or activity may apply to more than one behavior/competency. Tasks and activities should be explicitly stated according to the services offered by the agency.  Refer to the examples below for guidance: 

For Competency 5(a): “Student will research relevant local, state, and federal policies that influence the services provided by the agency.”  
For Competency 7(a): “Student will complete bio-psycho-social-spiritual assessment for each new client.”
For Competency 3(b): “Student will review agency policy manual and highlight any policies that may violate client human rights or restrict access.”
For Competencies 1(b) and 8(b): “Student will maintain a caseload of 7-10 clients, providing case management and crisis intervention services.”

Competency 1:  Demonstrate Ethical and Professional Behavior Program Outcomes: 1, 2
Educate colleagues about the legal and ethical implications impacting practice?
Goals and Activities:My goals at Mercy House demonstrate a professional demeanor in behavior; appearance; and oral, written, and electronic communication. Use technology ethically and appropriately to facilitate practice outcomes. Focusing on my Veterans I would give them the necessary resources that will assist them in receiving information on their benefits I would also inform them that the VA is a beneficiary system that has a moral commitment to care for the needs of those that served this country. I would also have sessions with my Veterans and other clients to have the opportunity in setting SMART goals in a written and verbal manner so that they will have a reminder of the goals they have set and what they need to achieve the goal by their chosen time. 
Make ethical decisions by applying standards of the NASW Code of Ethics and as applicable the IFSW/IASSW Statement of Principles?
Goals and Activities: When meeting with my Veterans I will make sure they are always treated with Dignity and Respect. I will make sure that my Veterans Veterans cared for in a manner that is needed for them, which can be different for other clients. I supply the Veterans the resources such as PATH Making It Home which is a Supportive Service for Veteran Families (SSVF). This program assists Veterans that are Homeless or on the verge of becoming homeless. This supplies the Veteran with the feeling that their human rights, and they are receiving social justice and they are having they are receiving their respect. 
Take leadership as needed to demonstrate appropriate ethical and professional conduct to colleagues and others in communities, organizations, teams, etc?
Goals and Activities:I will always advocate for clients, communities, and organizations I would have a session with my Veteran and let them express themselves to me and I will assist them in setting their SMART goals. I would Write down their Specific very detailed goal. Measurable by determining the time frame and how often they will repeat the process. Action-Oriented to see what is needed to achieve the goal . Realistically have them take a look and make the decision if this goal is worth it for them. Then set a specific date and time to achieve their goal. 
Competency 2: Engage Diversity and Difference in PracticeProgram Outcomes:  1, 2, 5
Evaluate the extent to which a culture’s structures and values may oppress, marginalize, alienate, or create or enhance privilege and power?
Goals and Activities:I would investigate if when the Veterans were released from the service where they were not given their benefits information such as a DD214, which is their discharge form that is used to access all of the benefits to the Veteran such as housing, and could assist the Veterans that are at the shelter as housing. I can lead the Veterans to those that are working for my government in my non-profit agency and can assist them in receiving vouchers through HUD-VASH the Government. All of the resources that I provide will guide my Veterans to not feel or be oppressed, marginalized, or alienated like being out on the streets. 
Take leadership in their practice settings to develop and/or change policies and practices that negatively impact clients from non-dominant cultures and minority populations?
Goals and Activities:I will take a leadership role by making sure that I let the Veteran lead and feel comfortable with expressing themselves and I will treat them in a non-judgemental manner. I will make sure that they understand that I recognize the fact that they have sacrificed their lives for this country and I can be their cheerleader that will recognize their mindsets and what assistance they are in need of to ease any mental anguish they may be dealing with. I will also contact resources that the veterans can speak with comfortably if they need to speak with someone that has been in their position. 
Educate colleagues about the impact of personal bias on practice and model cultural humility for those on inter-professional teams serving clients from non-dominant cultures?
Goals and Activities:I would start with that one must start by creating a cultural self-reflection and self-awareness and acknowledging their own cultural norms, behavior, attitudes, and outlooks. This way one can recognize and examine their own biases, prejudices, and stereotypes. Cultural competence and cultural humility are the foundation of understanding the clients and their cultural circumstances. I will consistently express my expression to my colleagues to 'Never judge a Book by Its Cover explore the book by opening it and seeing what chapter in life the client is actually on. This way one can know what assistance they can provide or what other resources the client may be in need of. 
Critique and apply knowledge of multicultural purism when engaging individuals, families, communities, organizations, and groups?
Goals and Activities:In this one has to again create an understanding of their cultural values and beliefs and this can help one appreciate the importance of multicultural identities of individuals. Deeply explore practices of advancing human rights, and social along with economic justice to modify involvements when they are needed. I know that there are many divers 
Competency 3: Advance Human Rights and Social, Economic, and Environmental JusticeProgram Outcomes: 1, 2, 4
Apply knowledge of the effects of oppression, discrimination, structural social inequality, and historical trauma on clients/constituents and their systems to guide intervention planning?
Goals and Activities:The knowledge and expression of the effect on individuals that have been affected by depression, discrimination, and societal inequalities We must apply the education of knowing that different systems of oppression are individual, institutional, and societal and know that their effects on people are deeply rooted in history and American culture. Realize and have the knowledge that Discrimination affects people’s opportunities, their well-being, and their sense of agency. My goal is to help prevent clients from persistent exposure to discrimination which can lead individuals to embody the prejudice or stigma against them, creating shame, low self-esteem, fear, and stress, which can lead to poor health as well. I will use my knowledge to fight to help demolish these systems of oppression and fight racism. 
Pursue change in agency policies and systems that may violate human rights and restrict access to basic needs for clients and communities.
Goals and Activities:My goal at my agency would be to advocate for my clients and the communities that I serve to pursue the change of policies that violates clients' human rights and restricts access to the basic needs of clients. This can involve me working with community organizations, lobbying for policy changes, and raising awareness about the issues. I can also work within my agency to identify and address policies and practices that may violate human rights or restrict access to basic needs. Then I can also Collaborate with other social workers and professional advocates that are in similar or the same field as I am and can also help advocate for change as well. 
Focus on prevention of human rights violations through advocacy and education?
Goals and Activities:There are several routes I could take to focus on the prevention of the violation of human rights. The first avenue I could take would be to establish a legislative framework, which would include measures such as human rights education and planning and monitoring tools that can contribute to the prevention, in the development of policies.

You can also support civil society organizations (CSOs) that work towards the prevention of human rights violations through advocacy and education. These organizations often engage in activities such as training, advocacy with authorities, detention monitoring, outreach activities, and prevention of violent extremism and sexual violence. 
Develop strategies to combat human rights violations and seek social, economic and environmental justice for clients and communities?
Goals and Activities:I can come up with strategies to fight against human rights violations and research for social, economic, and environmental justice for clients and communities by obtaining knowledge about social justice issues and taking a deep look at my beliefs and habits. I can also search for local organizations that take positive action in my own community. Then I could utilize the power of social media, attend demonstrations and protests, volunteer, and be able to donate. 
Competency 4: Engage in Practice-Informed Research and Research-Informed PracticeProgram Outcomes: 1, 3
Critically evaluate evidence-based and “best practice” treatment interventions, while incorporating knowledge from other countries and international social work research?
Goals and Activities:The first way I would start is by creating a clinical question then I would look for evidence to make it valid The steps would be to create a treatment plan to find my data, by means of formulating hypotheses and running an experiment, analyze outcomes, and keep track of them, and use your data to guide future treatment.

When I am assessing the evidence, I'll keep in mind that each type of evidence has a unique purpose for your clinical decision-making. Internal evidence, or the data and observations collected on an individual client, is collected both for the accountability of your session and for tracking a client’s performance. When assessing the internal evidence, you are determining whether an intervention has affected your client. External evidence, found in the scientific research literature, gives you answers to clinical questions such as whether a rating measures what it is planned to measure or if a treatment approach is successful at causing the change in individuals.

Then to Include knowledge from other countries and international social work research may be challenging as the literature in this area can be broadly multi-disciplinary, making it important to collect from many resources. A lot of the literature may be found in, peer-reviewed journals, on organizational or government websites. Additionally, reporting standards for interventions vary widely, resulting in additional challenges for evaluating whether or not an implementation method will be effective in your setting of interest. 
Apply evidence-based and “best practice” treatment interventions, using knowledge from international social work research as well as US-based practice evaluation research?
Goals and Activities:Applying Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) refers to the process where the practitioner combines well-researched interventions with clinical experience and ethics, client preferences, and culture to guide and inform the delivery of treatments and services. In social work, establishing evidence-based practices involves choosing, applying, and assessing practices and interventions meant to prevent or improve social conditions and problems. As well as in the international social work spectrum as well it is the process of researching elements that are ethical and based on clinical experiences. 
Recognize that research may be biased in favor of Western understandings of health and well-being and critique accordingly before intervening with clients based on that research?
Goals and Activities:I must be able to recognize and be aware of any biases that may exist in research and to critically evaluate the evidence before applying it in practice. Biases can occur at both the interpersonal and institutional levels of healthcare and can lead to people receiving poor treatment or inaccurate diagnoses.
One way to recognize and address potential biases in research is to work with people from historically marginalized groups and have education on health disparities. It is also important to consider the cultural surroundings of the research and whether it is applicable to the population you are working with 
Distinguish, appraise, and integrate multiple sources of knowledge, including research-based knowledge and practice wisdom in order to improve practice, policy, and service delivery?
Goals and Activities:As social workers, we must know the principles of logic, scientific studies, and
thinking of life one must have discernment. One must use critical thinking with creativity and curiosity. Critical thinking also requires the synthesis and communication of necessary information. We as social also analyze several make-ups of assessment, prevention, intervention, and evaluation as well. Also, we must be able to effectively communicate vocally and by writing with individuals, families, groups, communities, and our colleagues. 
Competency 5: Engage in Policy PracticeProgram Outcomes: 1, 2, 5
Develop new policy approaches to social issues or problems, based upon non-Western and/or global policy perspectives?
Goals and Activities:One approach would be to is to pay new attention to non-Western societies’ histories, cultures, and philosophies and then hypothesize international relations. Another route would be to participate in and donate to policy designs and fulfillment with amended or altered views of policies that are unfair, oppressive, and discriminatory to people. This can include evaluating the existing policies and creating new policies or changing/improving existing policies with adherence to values and principles. 
Apply policy analysis and advocacy skills to inform policymakers and influence policies that impact clients/constituents and services?
Goals and Activities:Some commonly used advocacy techniques include crucial arrangements like keeping an eye on policies and dialogues of those policies, organized groups to fight for policy change, and trailblazers for projects that can have an influence on policymaking. 
Educate colleagues and others about alternative approaches to solving social problems using collectivist, communal and universal policy orientations from around the world?
Goals and Activities:I would be to do research and collect information on accomplished examples of the policies and their success. Then I'd share this information with my colleagues through presentations, discussions, or workshops. Then I would suggest that experts or organizers be invited on field trips to see these policies in action could also be effective ways to educate others. 
Educate policy makers about the global approaches for social problems and advocate for policies that focus on prevention as well as intervention?
Goals and Activities:The route I would take is that would gather and display data and research examples that were and are successful policies from around the world. Also, I would organize meetings or conferences with policymakers to present these necessary approaches and inform them of those that have potential benefits. Then collaborating with organizations and groups that advocate for clients and have the same goals which will show the increase in my impact. 
Competency 6: Engage with Individuals, Families, Groups, Organizations, and CommunitiesProgram Outcomes: 1, 2, 5
Apply empirically supported, culturally sensitive communication and relationship building strategies at individual, family, group, organization and community levels?
Goals and Activities:I would start by researching and understanding the cultural norms and values of the people you are working with. This will help me tailor your communication and relationship-building strategies to be respectful and effective. Additionally, using active listening, empathy, and open-mindedness can help build trust and foster positive relationships. It’s also important to regularly examine and adjust your strategies based on feedback and changing circumstances. 
Demonstrate leadership with colleagues to improve the preparation of all social workers in skills of engagement, including cultural humility, respect for the different life experiences and expectation of clients, and culturally sensitive practices required for effectively engaging with clients/constituents?
Goals and Activities:I would lead by example and model these behaviors in my own interactions with clients and colleagues. You could also organize training sessions or workshops to share knowledge and best practices on these topics. In addition, providing regular feedback and support to my colleagues can help them develop and improve their skills in these areas. 
Establish an engagement process that encourages clients/constituents to be active participants in the establishment of intervention goals and expected outcomes?
Goals and Activities:I would start by establishing a welcoming and overall environment where clients feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas. You could also involve clients in the decision-making process by asking for their input and feedback on intervention goals and expected outcomes. Regularly reviewing and adjusting these goals and outcomes based on client feedback can help ensure that they remain relevant and effective. 
Apply global perspectives and global social work theories and practices to engage with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities?
Goals and Activities:Start by researching and understanding the cultural norms and values of the people that you are working with. This will help you tailor your engagement strategies to be respectful and effective. As well by using an approach that focuses on special strengths and resources of individuals and communities can help empower them to take an active role in addressing their own challenges. It’s also important to be able to adjust your strategies based on feedback and changing circumstances. 
Competency 7: Assess Individuals, Families, Groups, Organizations, and CommunitiesProgram Outcomes: 1, 2, 5
Apply cultural humility and a strengths-based perspective when assessing clients?
Goals and Activities:This would start with cultural competence respecting the cultural differences and the unique experiences of each client. This helps you to have the open-mindedness and willingness to learn from clients about their culture and experiences. Using a strengths-based approach involves focusing on the unique strengths and resources of each client, rather than solely on their challenges or problems. This can help empower clients to take an active role in addressing their own challenges and achieving their goals. 
Provide an accurate assessment of clients using global perspectives and theories as needed and multiple sources of information to fully understand the strengths, needs, resources and plans of clients and plan interventions?
Goals and Activities:Start by gathering information from multiple sources, including the client themselves, their family and community members, and relevant records or documents. Using global perspectives and theories can help you understand the cultural context and special experiences of each client. 
Take leadership when appropriate on inter-professional teams and collaborate with colleagues to ensure thorough and accurate assessments are done?
Goals and Activities:Taking leadership on inter-professional teams I would begin by starting with discussions, analysis, and assessments, that lead to a shared vision. Collaborative leadership creates an environment for easy collaboration and intentionally considers factors for good teamwork.

In interprofessional health teams, coordinating leadership and the need for appropriate clinical expertise involves a tension between the traditional role of the team leader as an authority figure and collaborative leadership which enables individual team members to come forth as leaders in their area of expertise and to relinquish this leadership as needed?
Competency 8: Intervene with Individuals, Families, Groups, Organizations, and CommunitiesProgram Outcomes: 1, 2, 4, 5
Plan interventions based upon culturally appropriate techniques supported by evidence of effectiveness?
Goals and Activities:The first approach would be to improve cultural competency in healthcare. When reviewing there was evidence of slight improvements in provider outcomes and healthcare access and but weaker evidence for improvements in patient/client outcomes.

Another approach is to make effective cultural adaptations to evidence-based interventions. This process includes attention to many dimensions of culture and involves active co-leadership with targeted communities, as well as feedback from the final beneficiaries of modified interventions. Cultural adaptation refers “to the systematic modification of an evidence-based treatment (EBT) or intervention protocol to consider language, culture, and context in such a way that is compatible with the clients’ cultural patterns, meaning, and values"". 
Infuse non-Western practices into interventions as appropriate to the client’s needs and in keeping with a strengths-based approach?
Goals and Activities:By, Infusing non-Wesncorporate concepts such as occupational consciousness, cultural humility, and ubuntu, which is a traditional African idea that embodies virtues to maintain harmony and the spirit of sharing. These concepts can help practitioners to better understand and address the occupational needs of individuals and communities around the world.

It is also important to consider the evidence base for any intervention and to adapt practices to fit the local context while staying close to the foundational evidence This may involve understanding the data behind an intervention and how it applies to the local context, as well as considering any legal or professional guidelines that may restrict options.

Eventually, it is important to work closely with clients and communities to understand their needs and preferences, and to incorporate non-Western practices in a way that is appropriate and effective for each individual. 
Understand the barriers clients face in accessing culturally appropriate services and intervene to design and develop effective and accessible services?
Goals and Activities:Understanding some of the barriers which are language barriers, limited resources, and cultural barriers. To be able to intervene and design effective and accessible services, some facilitators include cultural awareness amongst practitioners, cultural awareness in services, and explanations of health care systems 
Apply global principles of wellness and healing to intervention strategies and services accessed for clients or provided to clients by the social worker?
Goals and Activities:To apply global principles of wellness and healing is broken down by the World Health Organization (WHO) as health promotion which is the enabling people to increase control over, and improve their health. These global principles can be applied to intervention strategies and services accessed for clients or provided to clients by the social worker. 
Serve as a team leader on inter-professional teams to ensure services are coordinated and delivered according to clients’ strengths, needs, resources, and challenges?
Goals and Activities:The responsibilities of a team leader include decision-making, being a coach, mentoring and the development of the team’s skills, and controlling conflicts. It is also important to emphasize open and clear communication among the team members. 
Competency 9: Evaluate Practice with Individuals, Families, Groups, Organizations, and CommunitiesProgram Outcomes: 1, 2, 4, 5
Demonstrate the effectiveness of indigenous/ integrated healing methods into social work interventions for psychosocial problems at group, community, and organizational levels?
Goals and Activities:You start by demonstrating the effectiveness of indigenous/integrated healing methods in social work interventions for psychosocial problems at group, community, and organizational levels by integrating these methods with Western models of social work intervention. Research has shown that the use of only mainstream or Western therapeutic interventions has often proved ineffective for Indigenous clients. Integrating indigenous healing methods into Western models of social work intervention can help to address systemic problems that have led to disparities in mental health outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. It can also help to build trust between social workers and Indigenous clients. 
Demonstrate the effectiveness of indigenous/ integrated healing methods into social work interventions for psychosocial problems at the individual and family levels?
Goals and Activities:Research has shown that strengthening cultural identity, community integration, and political empowerment can enhance and improve mental health and substance use disorders in Indigenous populations. Integrating indigenous healing methods into Western models of social work intervention can help to address systemic problems that have led to disparities in mental health outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. It can also help to build trust between social workers and Indigenous clients 
Evaluate assessment techniques, prevention and intervention methods in own work with clients and agency work with clients and apply results to improve practice at the individual, family, group, organization and community level?
Goals and Activities:One can use many methods. For instance, collect data on the effectiveness of the techniques and methods you are using. This can be done through surveys, interviews, or other forms of feedback from clients and colleagues. You can also use evidence-based practices and research to inform your evaluations. Once you have collected data on the effectiveness of your techniques and methods, you can analyze the results to identify areas for improvement and make changes to your practice accordingly. 

Based on Veterans in  homeless Shelter!!",Sociology,social,WORK,
discussion question,"ennifer: Ending of One Life, Beginning of Another Case Study
Jennifer is a 26-year-old woman who gave birth three days ago to a healthy 9 pounds 2 ounce baby girl. The vaginal delivery was uneventful. Two hours after the birth, Jennifer began to complain of an “excruciating headache.” Within one hour of receiving acetaminophen for her headache, Jennifer became unconscious and suffered from a respiratory arrest. She was coded, placed on a ventilator, and sent to the ICU. A CT scan revealed that she had suffered from a massive cerebral hemorrhage. After it was determined that the damage to the brain was irreversible and that Jennifer would be unable to breathe on her own, her husband, Brett, made the decision that his wife should be removed from life support. “Our neighbor had Lou Gehrig’s disease and Jennifer would go visit with him and his wife. She always said she would never want to live like that,” stated Brett. However, Brett was not quite ready to have the ventilator removed. The Palliative Care team was called to visit with Brett, and also Jennifer’s parents. It was decided that Jennifer would be moved from the ICU down to one of the two new palliative care suites, and have the ventilator removed there.
Upon arriving to the palliative care suite, Brett and Jennifer’s parents were introduced to Nancy, the nurse that would be taking care of Jennifer and her family. Nancy was sensitive in talking with the family and had a great desire to find out what they wanted. The family agreed that the ventilator would be removed at noon the next day, to give family and friends an opportunity to say good-bye. Throughout the rest of the day, evening, and the next morning, over 75 people came to say good-bye to Jennifer.
Brett’s mother requested to stay with the new baby in the newborn nursery. Brett was so torn between spending time with his new baby girl and his wife. Nancy agreed that it was a good plan to have Brett’s mother care for the baby, while Brett concentrated on making decisions regarding Jennifer. Per Brett’s request, his mother brought the baby to the palliative care suite two times.
Jennifer’s pastor came by to spend time with Brett. He supported Brett in this very difficult decision. The hospital chaplain was also present. Nancy suggested some memory-making rituals such as taking a clipping of Jennifer’s hair, so her baby girl would have for later on. Footprints and handprints were made of Jennifer, per her parent’s request. A hand mold of the baby’s hand in her mother’s hand was made. Both Jennifer and the baby’s hospital name bands would be removed and placed in a memory box. Jennifer’s mother requested to bathe her. Brett brought in Jennifer’s favorite college sweatshirt to put on her. CDs of some of Jennifer’s favorite music were brought in and played.
The next day, as per the request of the family, the palliative care team reviewed with Jennifer’s family how they would extubate her. They talked about possible symptoms and how they would treat those. Brett, Jennifer’s parents, two brothers, and 12 other close friends were all together with Jennifer in the palliative care suite. The nurse from the newborn nursery brought the baby and laid her on Jennifer’s abdomen, per the family’s request. They were all reminiscing and telling Jennifer how much they loved her and how much she had meant to all of them. The palliative care nurse, physician, and chaplain were all present in the room and encouraged the family to take as much time as they needed. At 2 pm, the family reluctantly requested that the ventilator be removed.
When Jennifer was extubated, she turned cyanotic and began gasping for air. The team administered supplemental oxygen and morphine. Jennifer continued to gasp for air, and the morphine was doubled. This was repeated one last time until Jennifer was no longer dyspneic. Unfortunately, Jennifer remained cyanotic. Jennifer died 15 minutes, after she had been extubated. The palliative care team stayed with the family during the entire process.
The palliative care nurse made arrangements for Jennifer’s body to be picked-up by the funeral home directly from the palliative care suite. The family had requested that she not be taken to the hospital morgue. The team remained with the family, until the funeral home came. Once Jennifer’s body was removed by the funeral home, Brett left the palliative care suite to visit his new daughter in the newborn nursery. “One life so precious is gone, and yet, God has blessed me with another new life.”
Discussion Questions


Would you consider the death a ""good death""?  Why or why not?  Were the patient's and family's wishes followed?  Were pain and other symptoms well-controlled?  How were ethical and/or legal issues handled?
Discuss the collaboration among team members.  Who else could have been collaborated with and how would that have improved the death?

Athletic Director:  Wow! Our teams did terrific last week! I know much of their success can be attributed  to your food recommendations! Thanks so much! Now we need to work on  modifying their daily food intake, so they are ready every day to do  their best at practice and competitions. What changes should they make  to their diet? Remember, you analyzed their current diet for Assignment  1. This week, let's improve that diet. I'll let each coach explain what  they need.
Coach Speedy:  My runners are not consistently ready to meet the challenge of every  practice and competition. I think they need to eat the right balance of  the five foods groups daily, and those foods need to be spaced  appropriately before, and after practice, so they come to practice and  competitions ready to go. We practice at four in the afternoon for 1 1/2  hours. The conference championship is in two weeks.
Coach Power: We  have our final competition in four weeks. I need to push my lifters  without overdoing it. What changes do they need to make to their diet?  We practice for 1 ½ hour every morning starting at 7 am.
Coach Combo: We play every week,  and my team is getting beat up and worn down. Good news! We have made  it to the conference playoff. The team is pumped up, but we will be  playing a tough team. If we win this, we can go to a bowl game. We have  two weeks to replenish our body and get ready for the big game. I'm  going to pull out all the stops. What should we eat? We lift weights at 6  am and then practice on the field every afternoon at 3 pm for 2 hours.
Athletic Director:   Okay, now you have heard from the coaches. Time to start making your  recommendations. I know this will help each of the teams prepare for  their final competitions. For this assignment, you will modify one of  the team's diets from Assignment 1. If your name last name starts with  the A-H, then you will work with Coach Combo and make recommendations  for his football team. If your last name begins with I-P, then you will  evaluate a sample diet from Coach Speedy's Cross Country team. Finally,  if your last name starts with the letter Q through Z, you will assist Coach Power and his weight lifters.
You need to modify your team's diet,  so it meets the following recommendations. Use Cronometer to make the  modifications. You can use the same profile you used for the first  assignment, just add new days. Also, you will be adding and deleting  foods to the diet. Each diet consists of three days and the average for  the three days should meet the following recommendations. 

Calorie  intake is within 250 calories of the calorie level recommended by the  diet analysis program. Be sure you selected the appropriate activity.
All nutrients are >100% (Please note this is >100% and not equal to 100%). Be sure not to exceed the upper limit for a nutrient.
The source of calories from carbohydrates is >55%, and the source of calories from fat is <25%.

For the team you are helping, enter the following profile information into the Cronometer diet analysis program.

Coach  Speedy and her cross country team: Plan between 2500-3000 kcal/day for a  female athlete, 20 yrs old, 5 feet 5 inches tall, 135 lbs, maintain  current weight, the activity level is active
Coach  Power and his weight lifting team: Plan between 3500-4000 kcal/day for a  male athlete, 21 yrs old, 6 feet tall, 180 lbs, maintain current  weight, the activity level is active
Coach  Combo: Plan between 3500-4000 kcal/day for a male athlete, 19 yrs old, 6  feet tall, 200 lbs, maintain current weight, the activity level is  active

In this class, you learned the time you eat relative to  working out is just as important as the foods you eat. When should the  athlete eat the foods you recommend? How many hours before and after  practice? Are there certain types of foods they should eat? What about  fluid intake? Be sure to space out your food selections, so they meet  the guidelines you learned in class.
Remember, variety and moderation are the keys  to a healthy, well-balanced diet so the same foods should not be eaten  every day. Make sure your diet changes are different every day.
When  your diet plan meets the above objectives, screenshot your analysis or  print it to a pdf. You must submit this in the assignment area. Also, I  need you to write a report, so my coaches will know what changes you  made to their athlete's diet. Use Word to write your report. It should include the following:

List of meal or snack time and foods to be eaten at that time. (Be sure to space out your food selections, so they meet the guidelines you learned in class.)
Time when the athlete is working out
What foods did you add to their diet?
What foods did you remove from their diet?

Background
In March of 2000, a local mountain-biking club (Mountain-Bikers for Life) was organized for recreational purposes in West Virginia. Through the years the club had many members come and go, but the club continued to grow in popularity. As some members moved to other parts of the country, they began to form their own ""Mountain-Bikes for Life"" Club. The various clubs would even have events once or twice a year with one another. This sport has become so popular that, The Extreme Mountain Bike Racing League (EMBRL) was birthed.  The headquarter for the EMBRL is in West Virginia, but they have racing locations in Colorado, Maui, New England, Tennessee, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.
You went to college with the Mike ""Mountain Man"" Miller, who is the founder and CEO of the EMBRL. He has contacted you to see if you would be interested in creating a database application for his newly formed league. You have been doing contract work for an IT consultant form and have recently left to start your own business and this may just be the opportunity that you have been looking for to jumpstart your business.
After jumping at the opportunity, you scheduled a meeting with Mike to discuss his data needs.  After your initial interview with Mike and after having subsequent meetings, Mike has provided you with the Logical Design Criteria listed below.
Logical Design Criteria
The logical and relational requirements for the database that you are designing for the EMBRL are as follows:

The database must keep track of all of the riders who are part of the league. They need to have easy access to their personal address information, contact information, the date they joined the EMBRL and who their agent is.
 
Each rider is part of a given team. Each team consist of 4 riders. We need to keep track of the team name, the riders on that team.
 
Many riders have pushed the limit of their bikes by tinkering with them by adding to and/or taking away from the original design of the bikes.  This often gives some riders an unfair advantage over the other riders. It is important that the database keeps track of the approved mountain bikes, along with their name, description, weight and a picture. Also, it is important to know which bike a rider is using in a given race.
 
Since the potential is there for the riders to now get paid quite a bit of money for winning races and even participating in races or outside engagements, the riders thought it necessary that each of them have their own agent. Often, a single agent will represent one or more riders. We need to know the agent's name, address information, contact info and which riders they represent.
 
The EMBRL even has corporate sponsors. These sponsors give financial support to the various events (which consist of 1 or more races) and even directly sponsor individual riders. A rider may have 0, 1  or many sponsors and a company may also sponsor 1 or more events.  We need to know the name of the sponsor, address information, contact information, which riders they sponsor (if any) and which events (if any) they sponsor. Also, a given company can very well sponsor riders, or events or both, but they will sponsor at least one of them. You cannot be a sponsor and not sponsor anybody.
 
All advertising is first done at the Event level.  The Events may consist of 1 or more races. The races that make up a given event may be in the same location or different locations or even different levels of rider expertise.  The event information that we need to track is the name of the event, event location, address information, the beginning and ending dates and who the corporate sponsor of that event is.  Again, each Event may consist of one or more races. For example, you may have 4 races spread out over a given weekend that makes up one particular Event.  The race(s) that make up a given event keeps track of information about the location of the particular race, the rider's level of experience, the date of the race, the distance of the race and the start and ending times of the race in question.
 
Each rider can participate in one or more races. We need to know which riders are riding in which races and what approved bike they are using for that particular race.  Lastly, we will need to keep track which place the rider finished in the respective race that they are riding in. We will track all riders placements at the end of each race.  Each of these places has bearing on which team wins the overall season's title and prizes will be dispersed accordingly based on which team has the lowest points of the season.

PRACTICUM II**************************************************************
Response 1- Ashley
L. Describe your experiences and your role in building relationships with teachers, parent(s)/guardian(s), administrators, staff, and outside agencies.
“At its core, the role of a school counselor is to cultivate trusting relationships. These connections define the dynamics among counselors, students, and parents.” (2023) I have intentionally built collegial relationships with my supervisor, personnel, teachers, and students at my practicum site. For instance, when the gate opens in the morning for breakfast, the counselor and I welcome students and guardians, which often leads to conversations, which helps us learn more about the student’s home life.
I practice being present, actively listening, and consistently showing up, which reveals to those around me that I am committed and a trustworthy person.
Building relationships with teachers is more challenging as they spend most of their time in their classrooms. The chance to converse with them is only during dismissal when the teachers spread out to observe each gate, walking, bus, or pick up. Once the students are gone, the teachers return to their classrooms, and that is an opportunity to converse with them. I have also made following up a priority, for instance, when theirs a student who repeatedly is sent to the counselor or principles office for behavioral issues. If I run into the teacher and students are absent, I will ask the teacher about the student. They seem to appreciate it.
I also notice that students appreciate it when you remember their name, which is often tricky, being at a school with close to one thousand students. I often remember the classroom they are in or the group they spend time in at recess. Students enjoyed interacting with the counselor and started recognizing me more often.

Response 2 - Amelia

Describe experiences related to any of the following: School structure/program development.

I have been fortunate to have amazing supervisors that include me in the development of new programs and trainings. This can be good as it helps develop my leadership skills and allows me to work with other district leaders.  I have been given/taken the lead in training school site staff. This can become overwhelming sometimes because we our district has 24000 students and has 34 sites. There are 3 people that do what I do at the district, I have learned that when I am taking the lead, I still need to hold my counter parts responsible for also learning the information so that they can support their sites. I have had to redirect people to their contact person and also sometimes have conversations about attending trainings and reading handouts. One thing I hear a lot from school site staff is ""We are busy"" and have no time to read handouts or trainings. I advise them that all schools are staffed the same and if they are not attending trainings that was their responsibility. It took some time, but the culture is changing, and I am hearing less and less of the ""we are busy"" and ""this is how we have always done it.""  We are launching a new program in our department this upcoming year and I am trying to not take on a leadership role since I will be busy with internship hours, however I know that if I see things being communicated incorrectly or not being implemented correctly, I will step in and help. 

SOCIAL EMOTIONAL******************************************************
Response 3- Stormee
What are some possible interventions you may use to either increase or decrease either appropriate or non-appropriate behavior at school?
In the text, Gresham discusses the negative impacts on students throughout their school careers if they are not provided with the proper effective SEL interventions (2017). In order to effectively increase/decrease either appropriate/non-appropriate behavior at school, I would utilize a few different forms of interventions. First, I would perform a functional behavior assessment, or FBA. This would give me the opportunity to focus on antecedents, behaviors, and consequences by observing and checking in with a student. After my main assessment, I would utilize the multi-tiered system of support, MTSS. This would give me the knowledge to understand what tier they need help in. For tier one students, I would focus on classroom instruction and school wide initiatives in their daily activities throughout campus. For tier two students, I would emphasize individual reflection, small group counseling, and peer mediation. This would be for students who need that extra attention individually or with their peers at school. This is a way to work through those any issues on campus personally with each student. Tier three prioritizes improving students' mental health and social emotional success through outside referrals and resources. Interventions are dependent on each students needs. If a student is doing well, our interventions choices will help them stay focused and motivated. On the other hand, if the student is struggling with behavior or purpose, then our interventions will address helping them comprehend the repercussions while showing them alternatives to staying intentional.
As school counselors, it is essential to our success to create a dialogue with our students in order for them to comprehend and learn from the lessons we provide. If our students can trust and depend on us to be a supportive adult in their life, they will come to us when they need help. I currently work in a middle school and behavioral interventions are what we focus on. One specific social emotional learning intervention that I have been utilizing with my middle school students is the CICO system. The check-in check-out framework has been extremely effective with students at the intermediate level. I am able to meet with them at scheduled times, and it has been so helpful with keeping my students focused and on track with their goals. Another specific SEL intervention technique that we like to utilize is small group counseling. Especially in middle school, one of our biggest issues is rumors  spreading through class and social media causing drama and fights, Utilizing small group sessions has been extremely effective with breaking down that wall and creating a dialogue between our students. Being able to create that line of communication has helped us realize most of the time, these students just need their chance to be heard. 

Response 4- Angie

What are some possible interventions you may use to either increase or decrease either appropriate or non-appropriate behavior at school?

 As a school counselor we wear many hats during our day and help students through many different challenges whether it be academically, emotionally or socially. We want to be able to teach our students to have a more positive view of life as well as with their behavior. There are many different types of interventions we can put in place to help support our students whether it be interacting with others of similar challenges or spending time alone to reflect. The first intervention I find to be vital in education would be putting in place gratitude interventions. Studies have shown that, “gratitude interventions have proven benefits in increasing happiness and satisfaction (Wood, Froh, & Geraghty, 2010)”. We want our students to stay motivated and help create a more positive environment for themselves and others around them. Having our students write down their emotions, thoughts or ideas is also a great way for self-reflection which can ultimately lead to more positive interactions and decrease the number of altercations between students. This is something we can do with our students on a day-to-day basis as well as inform teachers and staff of how a simple “great job today” can go a long way. Another intervention counselors can put in place would be optimistic interventions which help create more positive outcomes since we are helping create realistic expectations. As stated, “Evidence suggests that although this may seem to be an easy task, non-directed imagination is a great way for people to understand how positive they are about themselves and others in life (King, 2001)”. At a young age we want to be able to teach our students to focus on their goals and strengths in order for them to achieve the life they want to create for themselves. As counselors going into classrooms to do presentations on SEL, academics or post-secondary plans we want our students to do activities as well to keep them engaged. Having them reflect in a small summary on where they see themselves in the future will help them gain insight on what they are doing wrong and what they can do better in order to reach their goals. This is great reflection for students who struggle with absenteeism, substance abuse, academically, etc. ",Sociology,writing,english,

Scenario
You are a patrol officer on duty with your partner. At approximately 1:45 a.m., you observe a fast-moving vehicle run through a red stoplight. You attempt to stop the vehicle, which refuses to pull over but does turn on its hazard signal. Using light detection and ranging (lidar) technology, you determine the vehicle to be traveling in excess of the posted speed limit. After a brief two-mile traffic pursuit, the vehicle pulls into a hospital emergency room ambulance bay. The male driver exits the vehicle with his arms raised in the air and begins shouting at you and your partner. A female passenger then exits the vehicle, also with her arms raised. She yells that her water broke and that she is in active labor and needs to get into the hospital. What step do you take next? How do you address the situation?

Applying your role as a summer intern for the not-for-profit organization( attachment), you will continue preparatory work on the strategic plan by addressing the following: 
1. The Health Information Technology (HIT) standards are developed both by national and international organizations for local and global implementation. In the US, the national organization is NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology) and the international organization is ISO (International Standards Organization).

Compare and contrast the functions of these two organizations and their healthcare IT standards. Analyze their standard development processes. Which type of healthcare organizations should implement their standards and why? Assess the value of the standards on the international market as well as implications for not adopting the HIT standards globally?   

2. Health Information Technology increases both efficacy and quality of healthcare and aids in operational and strategic planning. Although it incurs initial implementation investment and then periodic recurring maintenance and updating costs, it does not generate direct revenue, but the healthcare managers need to justify these costs to the executive management.

Select two (2) methods or techniques that you would use to determine and justify the value of HIT. Evaluate both in terms of their pros and cons. Which of these two methods would you recommend to use for presentation to the management and why? Analyze how these two methods of HIT value determination differ from the traditional IT value determination for business and healthcare?

Practical Empowerment in Management
Our text introduced us to many famous leaders and theorists in the subject of management practices. Each was notable for the different studies and practices or methods they analyzed and professed.  In this course, I am going to help you develop some management tools and some philosophies, so that you can feel confident that your toolbox is full potential.
Fayol's 14 Principles of Management is part of my toolbox.  I have had to use it in several circumstances when I was forced to take over a disorganized company or had to perform as interim management over a department badly needing change.  One of the first things I do in a crisis situation is to assess the circumstances.  I use Fayol's as a starting block.  It is certainly not the only approach I use, but it has served me well.  I have literally gone through the 14 Principles and identified what I needed to address in the organization immediately.  Even if I don't have an immediate plan for change management, using Fayol's principles is a good place to start to stabilize a department or a mission-critical department.
Review the information on Fayol's 14 Principles linked here.Links to an external site.
Assignment
Research the 14 Principles listed at the link above.  Since the resource provided is an OER text, it may also have additional OER references for you to use in your research.  Pick a company or department in which you have worked.  Write a paper that appraises how the organization uses each of the 14 Principles.  If they are missing one, explain why they do not need it and, if they do need it, why they need to master that principle.  This is a concise paper, so try to keep it under 2 pages.  
Why?
If you ever find yourself in a situation that is hard to management or working under circumstances where you are responsible for cleaning up a situation that is already crashing and burning, you have a starting point for analysis by using Fayol's Principles.  It may not be what you end up with for your final answer, but it will stabilize the situation and put you in the right direction.",Business & Finance,Assignment,,

Communication is important for a member of management, but it is mission-critical when management communicates with the employees.  In order to not only empower your organization, but bring strength and character to your organization, you need to be able to write objective statements that can help your employees succeed.  While planning is important, if you cannot write your objectives that are driven by your planning cycle into events that can be monitored, your planning will fail, no matter how good the ideas are.  Put the requirements for SMART Objectives in you toolbox to use them to quickly get employees under control in terms of their evaluations and defining what work they should be doing.

Measures of Central Tendency and Measures of Dispersion
Hello Everyone:
The discussions on descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics have been good. Descriptive analytics typically use measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion. Measures of central tendency tell you where the data is located while measures of dispersion tell you how the data is spread out. Think about a horizontal number line. The measures of central tendency tell you where the data set is centrally located on the line. The measures of dispersion tell you how much the data is spread out on the line.
What are some of the measures of central tendency we can use to describe a set of data?
What are some of the measures of dispersion we can use to describe a set of data?

Week 6 Problem (MKT6250 Healthcare Marketing),"  
Week 6 Problems 
Chapters 13 and 14

The director of      a cardiac rehabilitation program was recently approached by a sales      representative from the community newspaper selling advertising      space.  The sales representative underscored the fact that the paper      had the largest circulation of any of the three papers serving the area,      had just implemented a digital edition, and had the lowest cost per      thousand.  Before deciding to use this medium, what other factors      should the program director consider?
You have just      been tasked with directing a major campaign initiative in the rollout of      the new regional comprehensive cancer center.  Although historically      the medical center had relied on traditional media, the marketplace has      shifted and will now be allocating a greater proportion of the budget to      digital approaches.  However, one concern is that in the immediate      metro area, there are still two major newspapers that have strong      readership among seniors along with a monthly metro magazine.  The      medical center's Facebook page has approximately 16,000 followers, which      is quite strong, and an active blog page.  You recognize that it is      important to consider testing any copy for the various media alternative      that you use.  What approaches should be considered for the alternative      media under consideration?
Describe how      you would balance the allocation of f2fversus digital sales support to the      following scenarios as a sales manager: 
    
Your company       has received an email request for a reorder for a total knee prothesis       and instrumentation system.  You are the sales manager for Smith       & Nephew (https://www.smith-nephew.com/key-products/orthopaedic-reconstruction/anthem/       
Links to an external site.).        The health system has ordered from you in the past.  Should you       direct its representatives to the website with an order form and invoice       them or send the representative to the health system?  Is there some       combination that may be more appropriate?
As the       director of physician liaisons for a major academic medical center in the       southeastern part of the United States, you have just met with the chief       medical officer (CMO) of the clinical practice.  The institution has       received approval for its proton-beam therapy center and is fast-tracking       the facility building of the center because a donor has committed funds,       and it will be a joint venture with a proprietary organization.        Opening is scheduled for 18 months. The CMO has asked you for a sales       plan to educate the physicians in the four-state referral region over the       next six months as well as how the plan will evolve over time as it moves       to opening date.  Describe the evolution of the plan relative to its       emphasis in terms of f2f, digital, or hybrid strategy.


A manufacturer      of prosthetic devises has decided to review his company's sales      compensation system.  Historically, sales-people were paid on      straight salary.  Although the company has grown in recent years, the      president is convinced that the sales force could generate more sales      volume.  A major part of the sales job is missionary, yet with the      increasing number of physician groups expanding into rehabilitative      medicine, a new target market is possible.  The manufacturer is also      concerned that not all the products in the line have the same      margin.  What form of compensation would you recommend?
