An annotated bibliography is a list of citations of resources (books, journal articles, websites, etc.) followed by a brief description and evaluation. This helps you keep track of each resource, its relevance as it pertains to your study, and its credibility and quality. Your evaluation of each resource may include the purpose and scope of the study, the theories consulted, the conclusions derived, the research instruments used, etc. As you review your annotated bibliography, you can get a quick assessment of the literature you have explored on a particular subject, and this, in turn, helps you decide what to further examine.
In this Assignment (Part 1), you will review five articles, which you identified in the Weeks 3 and 4 Discussions. In Week 7 (Part 2) and Week 8 (Part 3), you will further develop your annotated bibliography.
To prepare for this Assignment:

Psychology Premise Completion & Doctoral Committee Matching Assignment," 
This assignment has two parts. First, you will complete a premise on your proposed dissertation topic. Second, you will complete the Doctoral Committee Matching form and submit the premise for committee matching.
Students who already have a chair:

If you have a chair but need a second committee member, please complete Part I and Part II. For Part II, you will indicate you need a second committee member on the form and not a chair.
If you already have both a chair and a second committee member, please submit a document to your instructor indicating you already have an approved committee and provide the names of chair and SCM.

Part 1: Premise Completion
As noted in the Dissertation Premise Guide, the premise consists of four parts:

title
problem statement
approach (i.e. proposed methodology) for the study
references

The Dissertation Premise document is used in two ways:

To identify a preliminary topic (i.e., a research problem) for your dissertation. This topic should be the product of an initial investigation on your part but will be subject to change and refinement and will inform the development of your prospectus.
To help match the faculty members who will guide your development of the Dissertation Prospectus. This process varies across different programs, so please follow the guidance in your program of study.
For a sample premise and description of the premise, see the Premise Guide: https://academicguides.waldenu.edu/ld.php?content_id=34219768

Part 2: Doctoral Committee Matching Assignment
This week, you will also complete the Doctoral Committee Matching form using the link below. Program leadership will use information provided via this form to review your plans and needs to match you with an appropriate committee chair and second committee member. While not required, you may request specific faculty from your program to serve on your committee. Please note that, while we would like to honor all requests, the program leadership must take a number of factors into consideration, such as faculty availability and expertise, when completing matches.
You will start working with your chair when you take PSYC 8115 Writing A Quality Prospectus and will continue with your chair when you move into PSYC 9000.

Week 4 GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE AND THE CONTINUUM OF VIOLENCE
     Globally, one in three women will experience gender-based violence (GBV) at the hands of an intimate partner.  Data shows that since the outbreak of COVID-19, GBV in the form of domestic violence, particularly targeted against women and girls, has escalated.  In fact, domestic violence has been so pervasive during the pandemic that the UN has called it a “shadow pandemic” (UN, 2021). 
Question #3.  How does the escalation of domestic violence during COVID-10 exemplify the concept of the continuum of violence? In answering this question address:  how women and girls have experienced GBV pre-conflict (pre-pandemic), conflict (during the pandemic) and how do you think women and girls might fare post-conflict (post-pandemic) as things get back to “normal” based on the status of women currently in society, e.g. whether you think levels of domestic violence will decrease as women and girls are able to spend more time outside of the home and the stress of the pandemic subsides.  
WEEK #6 INTEGRATING A GENDER PERSPECTIVE-GENDER MAINSTREAMING AND GENDER ANALYSIS
     A gender perspective is defined as “a way of assessing gender-based differences of women and men reflected in their social roles and interactions, in the distribution of power and access to resources” (NATO, 2012).  We will expand on that definition to include all genders, plus intersecting factors such as those mentioned previously such as race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ageism, ability, income level or religious affiliation
    In integrating a gender perspective, gender mainstreaming is a policy strategy which considers both women's and men's interests and concerns.  A gender analysis is an important aspect of gender mainstreaming as a systematic methodology for examining the differences in roles and norms for women and men, girls and boys; the different levels of power they hold; their differing needs, constraints, and opportunities; and the impact of these differences in their lives.
Question #5.  In applying a gender perspective, what were the impacts on different genders during the 2005 tsunami in Indonesia?  In answering this question, address the following: the capacities and vulnerabilities of women and men prior to and after the disaster; how women and men were affected and responded differently to the tsunami and to what extent; the different roles women and men played in ensuring the survival of themselves, their families and communities in the face of disaster; the different resources (economic, financial, physical, natural, other assets) and information that were available to women and men at the time of the disaster.",Homework Answsers,Sociology,women

Congress enacted the USA Patriot Act after the September 11, 2001 attacks. The Act significantly expanded the federal government's surveillance and intelligence gathering capabilities. One of the new tools at the Government's disposal is a National Security Letter (NSL). An NSL is an administrative subpoena that allows the FBI to demand personal records from organizations without prior court approval and prohibits disclosure by the recipient. In 2006, in the town of Windsor, CT, librarians found themselves on the receiving end of an NSL for patrons' records. Rather than meekly submitting to the gag order, they sued the Government. Libraries across the country began to engage in acts of civil disobedience. Notices were posted warning patrons that their search histories, passwords, and emails could be subject to FBI surveillance, and documents with personal identifying information were shredded. Signs appeared daily on library doors telling patrons which organizations had visited the library.
The American Library Association (ALA) publicly opposed parts of the Act. Believing that they violated the library community's long-standing commitment to privacy and freedom of access to information, it adopted a resolution calling certain sections of the Act ""a present danger to the constitutional rights and privacy rights of library users."" The ALA urged ""all libraries to adopt and implement patron privacy and record retention policies that affirm that 'the collection of personally identifiable information should only be a matter of routine or policy when necessary for the fulfillment of the mission of the library."" State and local libraries followed suit, enacting their own resolutions or endorsing the ALAs.

Prior to beginning work on this final presentation,

Watch the BUS623 Week 6 Final PresentationLinks to an external site. video above with Brenda Forde, Program Chair of MBA.
Visit the Beefsteak Case Study page to review the Company Background Information Packet and the Company Background video.

For this class, The Beefsteak Reinforcing Culture Through Human Capital Development Case Study Analysis final presentation assignment will apply toward Folio.
Scenario
Beefsteak is a fast-casual restaurant concept from acclaimed Chef José Andrés that focuses on the “unsung power of vegetables” (Beefsteak Company Background Packet, n.d., page 7). José Andrés is a world-renowned chef and owner of a number of restaurants. He was nominated for the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for his work with disaster relief through his nonprofit organization World Central Kitchen. Andrés’s mission is to change the world through the power of food. Jim Biafore, Senior Director for Beefsteak, knows that culture—much like any good business—is forever changing, adapting to its environment. As Beefsteak grows, he sees the need to develop employees not only for return on investment, but also for maintenance of the culture and values espoused from the larger organization, ThinkFoodGroup. Beefsteak needs to develop programs to develop its employees in line with the company’s mission and strategic direction.
Assume the role of a Beefsteak consultant dedicated to creating and reinforcing the company’s ideal culture. Jim Biafore wants you to assess Beefsteak’s current company culture, determine ways that it can be improved, forecast potential changes through growth, and provide a plan for sustaining cultural longevity through employees.
Using the materials provided to you, as well as at least two to three additional resources pertaining to human resource management, prepare a PowerPoint presentation with audio on the proposal for a strategic human capital development program focused on the transmission of company core values. You may use the University of Arizona Global Campus resource, Presentation TipsLinks to an external site., for assistance on adding audio to your presentation.
To communicate with Beefsteak’s Jim Biafore and executive team, you will present your analysis using PowerPoint with audio. The analysis should be six to eight slides. The strategic human capital analysis should reinforce the culture through

recruitment
training
retention
team development
organizational responsibility

The analysis should also consider Week 4’s contemporary human capital topic and predictive analysis.
Consider the following questions as you prepare your analysis:

What might you infer about Beefsteak’s current company culture? Does it have elements of organizational responsibility?
What key characteristics should Beefsteak recruiters look for in candidates, especially with regard to how someone will fit into the company culture?
How does job training and employee development differ from a cultural standpoint?
What motivates individuals or employees to believe in a cause?
What do employees want out of development programs?
What about employee development programs benefits the company?
Why is it important to think about employee development at this stage?
What contemporary human capital issues might you consider at Beefsteak?
Is it possible to use some predictive analysis technique?
How might things differ if Beefsteak expands globally rather than just in the U.S.?
How do you plan to measure the success/failure of your culture strategy? What steps will you take to ensure that the culture is shifting and/or being reinforced in that way that you intend?

In this presentation analysis,

Determine ways to improve the company’s culture in a growth environment.
Assess and make recommendations regarding the company’s recruiting, training, development, and retention strategies.
Integrate contemporary human capital topics and predictive analysis.
Discuss potential global expansion on the company culture and success.
Formulate an overall organized and concise proposal for the company’s ideal culture supported through human resource management.

Here is how to approach the final two sections.

Solutions: Last week, you identified the ethical challenges presented by your chosen topic. For each of those ethical challenges, you will need to provide an ethically sound solution. ""Ethically sound"" does not mean your proposed solution is definitively correct. It does not mean that your fellow students or your instructor will necessarily agree with it. All it means is that your solution is based upon a clear, cogent ethical framework, such as deontology, utilitarianism, or virtue ethics. In other words, it does not matter which side you take. What does matter is that you explain the ethical principles that support your proposed solutions.
Conclusion: In this final section, you will sum up what you have learned and end with a call to action. In other words, tell your readers what they can do to help implement the solutions you have identified.

Requirements:
Total length: (including the introduction, background, ethical challenges, solutions, and conclusion): At least 1,250 words

social problem ,"People who practice racial or ethnic discrimination are usually also prejudiced, but not always. Some people practice discrimination without being prejudiced, and some may not practice discrimination even though they are prejudiced. Individual discrimination is common and can involve various kinds of racial slights. Much individual discrimination occurs in the workplace. Institutional discrimination often stems from prejudice, but institutions can also practice racial and ethnic discrimination when they engage in practices that seem to be racially neutral but in fact have a discriminatory effect.
Respond to the following question:
Do you think institutional discrimination occurs because people are purposely acting in a racially discriminatory manner? Why or why not?

crime and society," 
Prior to beginning work on this assignment, read Chapters 9 and 10 from the required textbook. Select and then define a significant social issue faced by the justice system, evaluate the scope and consequences of the issue, and analyze society’s responses to the issue (including public policies and other less formal responses). Papers should also present a clearly reasoned alternative, supported by scholarly research.
While the following example can be modified to suit your needs, this outline is likely to result in a high-quality Final Paper:

Identify the problem. Be sure to narrow your problem enough to allow a focused examination.
Describe the individual, social, and criminal justice system implications of this problem. Discussion of implications should be supported by accurate research data.
Summarize what experts say about the problem.
Explain what you, as a society, have done to remedy this problem. Consider public policies and other, less formal responses.
Analyze to what extent public policies and other, less formal responses are effective in addressing this problem.
Propose an alternative solution to the problem.
Analyze why the alternative is, or can be, an effective response to the problem. Remember to consider negative consequences of the alternative response.
Conclude with your thoughts about your chosen social problem. This is a good place to include personal opinions, assuming you wish to share them in a research paper.

In short, define a problem, discuss the response, and provide alternative responses to the problem. For example, your problem could be drug use/abuse, with a focus on prescription drug abuse among teenagers. Your description of the problems should be fact based, relying on expert opinion. Your alternative response can be an adjustment of current policy or a new direction. For example, you may propose longer prison sentences, or legalization of all drugs. Be creative, although suggestions must be supported by scholarly research.
The Final Paper

Must be 8 to 10 double-spaced pages in length (not including title and references pages) and formatted according to APA style as outlined in the UAGC Writing CenterLinks to an external site.’s APA StyleLinks to an external site.

CSS Website help,"The Scenario
A startup company wishes to build a website for their online dating business. They have employed a designer who has produced the following design using graphics software. The software used by the designer only produces an image and does not produce HTML.

The company has now contracted you to implement the design, i.e. build the web page. The specifications include a working form component. The company thinks the designer has done a great job and wants you to implement the design without modifications.

Here is a mockup of the page that the client wants you to build:


Technical Overview
From a technical point of view, the webpage is constructed using HTML and CSS. Most of the HTML content are form elements. Some JavaScript will be required, but you will not have to write it, only follow the instructions to include it where needed.
Interactive Features
The client's specifications require you to have two interactive features in the web page. 

When the mouse is moved over any form control or its associated label, the label text will turn blue. When the mouse moves off it, it will return to its normal color. This will be accomplished using CSS. 
Immediately after the user selects the image of his/her face, the image is to be shown in the web page. A small piece of JavaScript will be provided for you to use for this. However, you are not expected to understand the JavaScript code at this stage, nor should you create any other JavaScript for this assignment.

Assignment Tasks

There are 3 tasks in this assessment.
    
For Task 1: You will use HTML to create the webpage structure and add content, without any CSS.
For Task 2: Apply visual styles to the webpage using CSS.
For Task 3: Add the interactive features to the webpage.


Each task has been further separated into smaller parts to help organize your approach. 
Detailed requirements and instructions are given below. 

Special Notes:

You will complete this assignment during the workshop using the Paired Coding method, which your instructor will explain to you before you begin. Paired Coding is a very common collaborative coding method that many teams use, especially with junior developers. Practicing the paired coding method in your workshops will give you experience with this type of collaboration, as well as make the workshop experience more interesting and productive.
As this is a mock client-contractor scenario, you will be graded for accuracy. It is important that you carefully check your work against the design specifications provided to ensure that your finished product exactly matches the design. You should especially check things like spelling, capitalization, and punctuation, as these are commonly overlooked. This exercise will help you fine-tune your attentiveness to small details, which is a critical skill for developers.

TASK 1: Use HTML to create the webpage structure and add content
Part 1: Set up the document

Create a basic valid HTML5 document as you learned to do in Week 1. Be sure to set the DOCTYPE and an appropriate title and meta charset.

Part 2: Set up the form element

In the body of your HTML document, create a level 1 heading with the text Enter Your Details For Our Dating Website.
Beneath this, create a form element with three attributes:
    
Set the action attribute to ""https://us-central1-nucamp-production.cloudfunctions.net/post/formdata"".

Inside this div, add an input with attribute: type=""submit""
After the closing tag for this div should be the closing tag of the entire form element.

At the end of Task 1, your assignment should look like this in the Chrome browser:

TASK 2: Apply visual styles using CSS
Now you will need to apply CSS to make the webpage look like the design given to you by the company. Below are important notes from the designer passed to you by the company. You must use this information in your work. 
Use an internal stylesheet - add your CSS rulesets inside a style element in the head of your document. Do not use inline styles.

For the body element, set font-family to Verdana, Arial, sans-serif
For all p elements, set margin to 0.
For all legend elements, set background to purple, set border-radius to 10px, set color to white, set padding to 12px
For all fieldset elements, set background to lavender, border to 10px solid darkblue, border-radius to 20px, margin-bottom to 10px, and width to 720px
For all div elements, set margin to 10px
For all label elements, set display to inline-block, text-align to right, vertical-align to top, width to 200px
Create a ruleset with this selector:

input[type=""radio""]+label, input[type=""checkbox""]+label

This selector targets all labels that are neighboring siblings of inputs with a type of radio or checkbox. While the code has been provided for you, please try to understand it before you continue.
For all elements matching this selector, set width to auto. 
For all elements with a .range-caption class, set background to darkcyan, color to white, padding to 6px, text-align to center
For all input elements with a type of ""submit"" (hint: use an attribute selector), set background to darkcyan, border-radius to 10px, color to white, font-size to 20px, and padding to 12px.

At the end of Task 2, your assignment should look like this in the Chrome browser (note that the slider may look a little different on Windows and Mac machines, and that is acceptable):


TASK 3: Add interactive features
For this task, two types of interactive behavior need to be added. These interactive behaviors are demonstrated in the accompanying video.

In the internal stylesheet, add a ruleset with this selector: use a pseudoclass of hover on all div elements. Add a declaration of color: blue.
Add the following script element before the closing </body> tag. It is a link to a file containing JavaScript code. After this is added, the ""Your Face"" image will be immediately shown in the web page after the user uploads a file. The JavaScript code shows the selected image in the img element with id=""preview"" that you added in Task 1 under the file input.  

<script src=""https://url.nucamp.co/datingjs""></script>

Test both the interactive features.

Barrier #8 Lack of Opportunities for Advancement  
There are multiple barriers in leadership when it comes to nursing. Many of the barriers arise from different situations many nurses find themselves in (Nininger). ""For example, fear, negative prior experiences, and family commitments are barriers that depend on the nurse to resolve"" (Nininger).  These situations vary from region to region and nurse to nurse. One of the barriers that is more common across the board is lack of opportunities. The need for nurses continues to grow each year, more and more new nurses are entering the field on the daily. While nursing as a career continues to grow, the leadership does not. Leadership opportunities are far and few, making them very saturated with well qualified nurses. On top of it being a rare find, most leadership roles are found through networking taking the emphasis away from the bedside skill many new nurses need to perfect first.

Barrier #2; Nurses are not visible in healthcare policy making. 
According to Anders (2021), nurses are professionals who are directly involved in patient care. Engagement front line nurses have with patients, and other healthcare professionals, make them ideal healthcare policy advocates. They have appropriate academic education and clinical expertise to serve as experts in sharing their knowledge with policymakers and others. Any other profession cannot replicate the situational knowledge of the healthcare needs of patients that this large workforce offers.  
However, nurses' access to policy-making processes is limited. The author supports the concept of barrier by explaining that despite nursing's intrinsic involvement in the advocacy of the individual patient, the nursing voice is often not heard at a public level. Since nurses represent approximately 50% of the global health workforce, they should be actively involved in policy-making processes. However, nursing representation at the government and boardroom level is still slim (Anders, 2021).  
The author suggests how nurses can participate in policy development. Meaningful policy change can occur at the institutional level, where nurses are accustomed to functioning. Nurses' involvement in self‐governance within hospitals presents opportunities for staff nurses to participate in the clinical governance at a local level. Nurses can also begin as a member contributing to online discussions, blogs, or social media interest groups sponsored by the association, then progress to active participation in any number of subcommittees, and finally run for office.

Assessment 4 Instructions: HRIS Recommendations," 

Create a 10-slide PowerPoint presentation for the organization’s management team in which you analyze and compare three human resource information systems.
Introduction
Familiarize yourself with the Guidelines for Effective PowerPoint Presentations [PPTX] to ensure your recommendations are clearly presented to the intended audience.
Instructions
Based on FFH's organization and culture, conduct an online search for at least three human resource information systems (HRIS). Management has decided to select a more up-to-date and user-friendly HRIS that will allow for employee self-serve options. Employees would be able to check in and out of work online, review their benefits and payroll information, and make changes to things like the number of exemptions, beneficiaries, level of benefits selected, et cetera. Data tracking including sales figures, absenteeism, and performance evaluations would also be an additional benefit.
Using your own research, include the following in a PowerPoint presentation for your three HRIS recommendations to an organization’s management team:

Analyze human resource information systems for attributes that meet FFH's employee needs. How will globalization and cultural and inclusive practices be supported by each HRIS?  
Develop a chart indicating the pros and cons for each HRIS. The chart should identify the three systems you selected, each website's URL, and supporting data. What analytical methods could be applied? 
Assess how workplace privacy can be supported by the selected human resource information systems.
Articulate your HRIS recommendations. How do your recommendations support FFH's goals?
Explain the potential cost savings of selecting one of the HRIS recommendations. Indicate at least five ways an HRIS will streamline HR processes and save the organization money. These might include tracking training programs, onboarding processes, succession planning, et cetera.
Select a slide template appropriate for a professional presentation. Include the content of the slides as well as a supporting narrative in the notes. Do not over-build your slides; use them to support what you will be saying, which should appear in the notes of each slide.
The presentation of your HRIS recommendations should demonstrate graduate-level writing skills through the accurate communication of thoughts that support a central idea and use of correct grammar and mechanics as expected of a human resources professional.
Additional Requirements

References: Support your analysis with at least two academic, scholarly, or professional resources from the Capella University Library.
Format: Resources and citations are formatted according to current APA style and format.
Length: Ten PowerPoint slides, in addition to the title slide and references list.
Font and font size: Times New Roman, 12 point.
Save this activity to your ePortfolio for future reference in the workplace.

BARRIER #9: VARYING EDUCATION LEVELS AMONG NURSES
Nurses play an important role in transforming health care; therefore, effective nurse leadership is required. Rising medical costs, increased competition among medical institutions and high demand for quality medical services are particularly calling for the efficient management of medical institutions, subsequently increasing the demand for nurses with management and leadership skills. Within nursing contexts, leadership creates an environment that both influences nurses to improve the quality of nursing care and motivates and empowers them through a clear vision. Effective leadership from management inspires positive behaviors in staff, such as organizational citizenship behaviors, further job satisfaction and organizational commitment. So, education is necessary to continuously improve nursing leadership abilities. Moreover, nurses can effectively incorporate their leadership education into their nursing practices and enhance nursing organizations' performance, while advancing the profession by providing leadership opportunities. The role of the nurse is changing with the transformation of healthcare, but unfortunately, the level of education typically remains the same, as evidenced by the small percentage of nurses who pursue higher levels of education. Baccalaureate education with its broader, more scientific base provides the sound foundation for the variety of nursing positions and for entry to advanced nursing education and practice. The barriers include a lack of specific education that is focused on clinical leadership and health team management, feeling devalued by the system, and a lack of a structural pathway of learning and development for the registered nurses. Although, all nurses cannot financially support themselves to achieve baccalaureate education requirements.
Nursing leaders' perception of nursing leadership was extended to nurses, organizations and nursing professions. Competency, capability, innate personality and traits are required nursing abilities that are acquired through education. Nursing leaders view nursing leadership as a broad, multidimensional concept and are keenly aware of the importance of education in its improvement over the long term.

Ethical Dilemma," 
Today's health care environment gives nurses many reasons to be conflicted. Genetic testing, abortion, and end of life care are just some of the areas in which nurses may face ethical dilemmas. Consider how you feel about the following issues:

Respecting the wishes of a suffering client that he is permitted to die with dignity,
Respecting the health surrogate's wishes regarding termination of life support,
Or even observing another nurse take two tablets of oxycodone as ordered but keeping one for herself.

Then give an example of an ethical dilemma you may have confronted in your own clinical experience or workplace. How did you come to the decision you made? What feelings did you experience while coming to that choice? (If you have not yet faced an ethical dilemma, research one and comment on it, answering the same questions.)
