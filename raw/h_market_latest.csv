Assessment Description
As a teacher of emergent readers, it is essential to understand the foundation of successful reading instruction. The science of reading tells us daily, explicit, and systematic instruction in phonological awareness is key to future reading achievement. Phonological awareness is the ability to identify and manipulate various units of sounds in speech, including syllables, onsets, and rhymes (DeVries, 2021). While phonemic awareness falls under the umbrella of phonological awareness its emphasis is primarily on the manipulation of individual sounds or phonemes.

1. Since the advent of polling, political scientists have found that Americans don’t know much about the details of political issues or even the names of many leading politicians. Education is one distinguishing factor that separates the politically sophisticated from the unsophisticated, but, since education levels have increased over the last half-century, why hasn’t Americans’ knowledge of politics increased? How does democracy survive given such low levels of political knowledge among Americans over time?

A Review of ""A Model System for Studying Plant–Microbe Interactions Under Snow"" 

Introduction 

Plants and microbes interact in ways that can impact agriculture, especially in places with 

long, snowy winters. The study ""A Model System for Studying Plant–Microbe Interactions 

Under Snow"" explores how the plant Arabidopsis thaliana responds to a snow mold fungus 

called Typhula ishikariensis under controlled snowy conditions (Kurokawa et al., 2021). This 

research is important because many crops, like wheat and rye, grow during the winter but often 

suffer from snow mold, leading to major losses in food production. Since farmers need better 

ways to protect their crops, scientists studied how plants defend themselves against this fungus in 

cold conditions. By understanding these defense mechanisms, researchers hope to develop 

stronger, more resistant crops that can survive harsh winters and improve food security (Smith & 

Jones, 2020). 

Hypothesis 

The researchers hypothesized that exposing plants to cold before winter, a process called 

cold acclimation would help them resist T. ishikariensis, the fungus that causes snow mold. They 

believed that cold temperatures would trigger specific defense responses in the plant, including 

activating genes that help fight off infections (Kurokawa et al., 2021). Their goal was to test 

whether plants that experienced cold temperatures beforehand would have a stronger defense 

against snow mold and to identify the genetic pathways responsible for this resistance. This 

hypothesis was based on previous research showing that plants undergo physical and molecular 




 3 

changes in response to cold, which might also improve their ability to fight off harmful microbes 

(Brown et al., 2019). 

Methods and Results 

The study’s results supported the researchers’ hypothesis, showing that A. thaliana plants 

that had gone through cold acclimation were better at resisting T. ishikariensis than those that 

had not. A detailed analysis of the plants’ genes showed that cold exposure activated defense-

related genes, helping the plant fight off snow mold infections (Kurokawa et al., 2021). To test 

this, the researchers used different methods, including creating controlled environments that 

mimicked snow cover, infecting plants with the pathogen, and analyzing gene activity. These 

experiments provided strong evidence that cold acclimation improves a plant’s ability to resist 

harmful microbes (Lee & White, 2018). 

Significance and Future Research 

This research is important beyond just understanding plant diseases. Learning how plants 

naturally defend themselves against snow mold in cold conditions could help scientists develop 

stronger crops through genetic modification or selective breeding. This could make crops more 

resistant to winter diseases, which is especially useful for farming in areas with harsh winters 

(Taylor et al., 2022). In the future, researchers should test if these findings apply to major food 

crops and explore other environmental factors that might affect how plants and pathogens 

interact under snow cover. 

 




 4 

Conclusion 

This study provides important insights into how plants defend themselves against snow 

mold in cold environments. The findings could help improve agriculture by offering ways to 

breed or modify crops to be more resistant to winter diseases. The research was well-organized, 

informative, and clearly explained, making it a useful resource for scientists studying plants, 

microbiology, and sustainable farming. Continuing to study how plants and pathogens interact in 

extreme conditions will be key to developing stronger crops and protecting food production as 

the climate changes.

Baseline Survey:

1.‘What experience do you have teaching or working with people with disabilities? I do not have experience working with students with disabilities. I am working now as a teacher assistant in ICT a class environment where I  amworking with students who possess different learning needs, from autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, through to speech and language impairment. These experiences have helping me understand the importance of individualized instruction, tolerance, and the necessity of developing an atmosphere that is tolerant and welcoming to everyone.  I am very happy working now with these students am aware that there is always something to learn, especially in learning new strategies and legal frameworks to further assist students with disabilities.

2.What questions do you have about teaching students with disabilities that you hope this course will address?
There are several questions that I hope will be covered in this course. Firstly, I am interested in understanding more about using high-leverage instructional practices effectively to support students with different needs. I am also keen on exploring how we can effectively implement assistive technology within the classroom for enhanced learning. A second area of interest is the process of creating culturally responsive individualized education programs (IEPs) from a student's strengths and areas of need. Last, I have a desire to know about best practices in collaborating with families and other educators in order to give students with disabilities the assistance they require to be effective in academic and social settings
3.What should I know to better support you this semester?
In a bid to further help me during this semester, I appreciate instructions and well-structured deadlines so that I can effectively manage my work load.

e: Coaching Vs Mentoring
from Griffin, Eric
posted 02/25/2025
updated N/A

In the field of Organizational Development (OD), coaching and mentoring are vital 
developmental programs that contribute to the growth and effectiveness of OD professionals. 
According to Anita, Survaningsih, Suhendra, and Gani (2024), “Organizational Development is 
essential for helping people grow”. However, the choice of which program is more effective 
largely depends on the individual's career stage, learning needs, and the organizational 
context.
Coaching is generally seen as more effective for OD professionals in need of immediate, 
specific, and goal-oriented development. It is a focused, often short-term process in which a 
coach works with an individual to address specific challenges or enhance particular skills. As 
Anderson (2020) stated, “Coaching helps an individual to improve themselves in a one-on-one 
interaction”. This could mean improving leadership capabilities, managing change, or 
developing strategic thinking in OD. Coaches tend to ask probing questions, provide feedback, 
and guide professionals toward self-awareness and action plans. The highly individualized 
nature of coaching allows for tailored solutions that directly address the OD professional's 
needs, making it especially effective in dynamic organizational environments where change is 
constant.
On the other hand, mentoring is a long-term developmental relationship, typically less 
structured, where a more experienced OD professional provides guidance, support, and insight 
based on their experience. Mentoring can be invaluable for building organizational knowledge, 
understanding culture, and navigating the complexities of OD practices.
Ultimately, coaching is often seen as more effective in developing specific competencies 
quickly, while mentoring fosters long-term professional growth and organizational integration. 
For an OD professional, both are important, but coaching may be more impactful when 
immediate skill development and performance improvement are required, whereas mentoring is 
more suited for holistic, long-term career development. A combination of both might offer the 
most comprehensive growth for an OD professional.

Re: Coaching Vs Mentoring

    I believe coaching and mentoring are both effective in developing organizational development 
professionals. Mentoring is generally done in an informal setting, whereas coaching is done in a 
formal setting. I personally feel mentoring is more effective in my organization. “A mentor is a 
counselor, adviser, and teacher who usually works in a one-on-one relationship with a protégé” 
(Anderson, 2020). Due to the nature of the industry that I am involved in, there is a 1% success 
rate, let alone long-term retention in the profession.  It is a very high-stress environment with a 
high turnover rate. Over the years, organizations have found the mentor-mentee relationship 
has been successful in their success rate. Mentoring programs are becoming increasingly more 
popular in organizations, especially in cases where a large number of older employees are 
retiring, and taking their knowledge and experience with them.
     Mentoring is building a relationship where an individual with more experience guides and 
supports the less experienced individual or employee. It can help in many areas. Most 
importantly, it can strengthen knowledge and build confidence. It provides support and can help 
with skills development. A mentee can feel encouraged and empowered, and work toward 
career goals when they have the power and back of the mentor. “Mentoring is a powerful 
empowerment tool where both mentor and mentee grow personally and professionally” (Rao, 
2025). Whether mentoring or coaching both transform the lives of people and help in 
individuals' professional development.

Organization and Leadership Evaluation,"Introduction 
For this task, you will write a paper on an existing organization with which you have had personal experience. The organization can be a business or a nonprofit, and you may represent any level of the organization (e.g., team, department, division, whole) in your analysis.

You will first describe the chosen organization. Your description of the organization should convey personal experience, rather than information gained from secondhand sources or media coverage. You will then perform a SWOT analysis on that organization. Last, you will analyze that organization’s leadership.

Note: Any information that would be considered confidential, proprietary, or personal in nature should not be included in the actual task submission to WGU. Do not include the actual names of people, suppliers, the organization(s), or other identifiable information. Fictional names should be used. Also, organization-specific data, including financial information, should not be included but should be addressed in a general fashion as appropriate. Work performed for clients and employers is their property and should not be used without written permission.Requirements
Your submission must represent your original work and understanding of the course material. Most performance assessment submissions are automatically scanned through the WGU similarity checker. Students are strongly encouraged to wait for the similarity report to generate after uploading their work and then review it to ensure Academic Authenticity guidelines are met before submitting the file for evaluation. See Understanding Similarity Reports for more information.  

Grammarly Note: 
Professional Communication will be automatically assessed through Grammarly for Education in most performance assessments before a student submits work for evaluation. Students are strongly encouraged to review the Grammarly for Education feedback prior to submitting work for evaluation, as the overall submission will not pass without this aspect passing. See Use Grammarly for Education Effectively for more information.  

Microsoft Files Note: 
Write your paper in Microsoft Word (.doc or .docx) unless another Microsoft product, or pdf, is specified in the task directions. Tasks may not be submitted as cloud links, such as links to Google Docs, Google Slides, OneDrive, etc.  All supporting documentation, such as screenshots and proof of experience, should be collected in a pdf file and submitted separately from the main file. For more information, please see Computer System and Technology Requirements. 

You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.
Write a paper (suggested length of 10–16 pages) by doing the following:
A.  Describe an existing organization with which you have had personal experience and its objective(s).
1.  Describe three leadership practices of the current leader, other than yourself, in the existing organization.
 Note: Leadership practices are routine actions, behaviors, functions, and responsibilities that the current leader performs.
2.  Discuss how the current leader has affected organizational culture.
 Note: You may represent any level of the chosen organization (e.g., team, department, division, whole) and the respective current leader in your description.
B.  Conduct a SWOT analysis evaluating the chosen organization by doing the following:
1.  Evaluate two of the organization’s current strengths.
2.  Evaluate two of the organization’s current weaknesses.
3.  Evaluate two of the organization’s current unmet opportunities.
4.  Evaluate two of the organization’s current unresolved threats.

Let's talk about citing sources using the APA format. We'll begin by looking at some reasons why your professors ask you to cite your sources in the first place. If you dislike having to do the nitty gritty work of citing, you're not alone. Every student in the history of education has thought the exact same thing. However, there are valid reasons why citing is important. First, if you don't disclose where the ideas in your papers are from, that is both plagiarism and academic dishonesty, and these, whether accidental or intentional, can come with serious academic consequences. Second, everyone likes to get credit for their ideas. If you had a great idea at your job, but then a co-worker stole that idea and took credit for it, you'd likely be mad. The same applies to intellectual ideas and research. Citing allows you to give formal credit to the originators of information you use in your papers. Third, because you generally use outside sources of information as evidence for your own arguments and assertions within your writing, citing those sources allows readers to weigh the soundness of the evidence. Formatting those citations correctly also allows readers to locate those sources themselves. Lastly, in this age of easy copy pasting and various cheating tools to write papers, citing your sources is one way you can show your professors that you've spent the time learning the existing knowledge about your topic and that your writing is backed up by solid evidence. Citing basics. When do you need to cite something? Basically, anytime you use information that is not your original idea. The only exception to this is common, widely known facts. Think of this like if you asked a random person on the street about it, is there a good chance they would know it? If not, it may not be widely known. And so even if you know it, you should probably find a source that states that fact and cite that source. When you cite something in your academic writing, you need to do so using a formal citation style. We're looking at APA here, but there are dozens of others used within various fields of study or in different parts of the world, such as MLA, Chicago, and more. The basic idea is when you need to cite something, you look up the guidelines and choose an example from those provided that matches the sources you have. In those cases where what you're citing doesn't fit neatly within a single example, which will happen, it's your responsibility to make a choice and apply the structure from that example to the information you have from your chosen source. When you cite, you need to have citation information in two places in your paper. In text, alongside the quoted or paraphrased information, and at the end of the paper in a bibliography, which in APA is called the References page. Let's take a closer look at in-text citing. In APA, the information you need to include in-text is author last name year of publication, and only if available, and not summarizing, the page number where the quote or paraphrase is located within the work. There are two ways to format an in-text citation. The first way is one you've likely seen the most, and if you've already done some citing, have used. This is called a parenthetical in-text citation. Parenthetical because the citation is put inside parentheses after the quote or the paraphrase. Here are some examples. Note the second example didn't have a page number, and so that part was omitted. However, there is a second way to format in-text citations, and I would argue in many circumstances, a superior way. This is called a narrative in-text citation, narrative because you can put some parts of the citation before the quote or paraphrase and integrate it into your own narrative voice. Here are some examples as above, but formatted narratively. If you compare the two sets of examples, they contain the exact same information, but notice the narrative citation can provide some additional context to your reader about who the information is from and when it was published. When you use sources as evidence for assertions in your writing, if you can provide that context before the quote or paraphrase is read, the persuasive power of the evidence is often increased. This format also just flows better when reading it. Let's look at some more examples to hammer home the differences between the in-text methods and why you should consider sometimes using narrative formatting instead of parenthetical. So on the screen is an example of a parent in-text citation. You have the quote, and then in parentheses, you have the author last name with a comma, then a space, then the year of publication, followed by another coma and a space, and then lowercase p period, space, the page number where that quote is located within the source. A narrative example, the same thing, states Jones, parentheses 2016, states that this is an example of a direct quote using the most common citation method. In this example, if there is a page number, the only thing that goes in parentheses at the end is the page number. Here are some more narrative in-text examples using paraphrasing, which we'll talk about next. And as you'll see, when you paraphrase, using the narrative in-text citation methodology is probably strongly suggested. So in the first example, we have: This condition has led to what Arthur Schlesinger junior, 1987, describes as a secrecy state, which is a source of power and an efficient way of covering up the embarrassments, blunders, follies, and crimes of the ruling regime. Page five in parentheses. Here's another example using a paraphrase summary of a work. In this case, the summary of a chapter. Freud, 1975, focuses especially on what he terms dream censorship, whereby the patient in describing dreams will omit key pieces of information in parentheses, chap. 9. So in this case, it's a summary of a chapter within a larger work by Freud from 1975. And for any other details like the title, the page numbers, things like that. You reader can then use the author last name and date to go to the bibliography at the end of the paper and look up those details. Now I'm asking you to pause the video and write out a narrative in-text citation with a direct quote of the passage below. There's no judgment here. This is just practice. Okay, if you're unpausing, I'm now going to forward to some possible solutions to creating a narrative in-text citation for this passage. So there's 2 examples on the screen of a narrative in-text citation. The first one says, Melillo, in parentheses 2014, found that the projected costs associated with 1 ft of sea level rise by 2100 are roughly $200,000,000,000. And since you'll note that there's no page numbers on the web document, so the page number and the parentheses at the end are omitted. Now let's look at the APA References page, the bibliography at the end of your paper. There are some general guidelines involved here. First, the References page is a separate page and it is titled References, which is centered and in bold at the top of the page. Each line after the first, for each entry, uses what's called a hanging indent, which is an indent of half an inch, and we'll look at examples of this in a moment. And if you're wondering how to create a hanging indent, there are methods within Microsoft Word that can allow you to do this after you've written out your references, and you can simply go to YouTube or Google and search on hanging indent Microsoft Word, and you'll see the methods to do that. Now your References page entries should be alphabetized by author last name. For middle and first names, you only use initials. Here's an example, Williams, space, J, period M. If there isn't a named author, what do you do? In most cases, you'll instead use what's called a group author. What you do is use the organization or agency that has produced the work as a substitute for the author. In the rare case where there's a completely unknown author, this usually refers to historical works where someone has written something anonymously or we simply don't know who wrote it. You move the title of the work to the beginning and don't have an author, and it's alphabetized that way. But in most cases, web pages and things like that, you'll use the name of the organization that has created the page. Now, here's one that trips up a lot of students because it's not intuitive, but it is the way APA does it. And that is, for article and book titles and subtitles, you ONLY capitalize the first letter of the first word of those titles and subtitles. The only exceptions are proper nouns, and here's some examples. So the first one is an article or a web page where you have Capitalist economies in Europe, colon Evolving or a dying breed. As you can see, Capitalist is capitalized with the C, and Europe because it's a proper noun, has the E capitalized. And then you have the subtitle Evolving or a dying breed, where just evolving has its first letter capitalized. And the second example, we have a book, and note that book titles are also in italics, but you have the same capitalization of the title. And take a note that if you use a citation generating tool, like as provided in a lot of the library databases, they can make errors, especially in the capitalization of titles. So while those tools can be a good starting point for generating references, proof read them, especially in the capitalization of the titles. Now, journal articles also include a journal title, and those are capitalized normally and also in italics. So sort of think of them like the similar to a book, they're what the article is in. So the journal title is capitalized normally, but it is in italics. Each entry on the APA References page should be double spaced. And a period should appear at the end of each entry unless you have a web address, a URL. In those cases, you do not have a period at the end of the entry. Now let's talk a little bit about what's called a DOI, which generally applies to journal articles only. This DOI stands for digital object identifier. And basically, it's very similar to a URL or a web address, but it's sort of platform agnostic, and it's not assigned to all journal articles, but if available, you use a DOI instead of the URL or web address that's normally displayed within the browsers' address bar. And in a lot of library databases, you'll often find the DOI listed there. If there isn't a DOI for a journal article and it's from a library database, you omit the web address or URL. And by the way, just a reminder that you aren't necessarily required or being asked to memorize all these details. And at the end, I'll show you where you can go in the library to look up all these details when the time comes. On the screen now are some example references formatted. So in the first one is a book reference, and you can see it as author last name, space, one initial, so there was no middle name. And then in parentheses, you have the date of publication. And then a period following that, you have the title of the book in italics with just the first letter of the first word capitalized with no subtle. And then because it's a printed book, you have the name of the publisher. Now, if it was an e book, you would likely instead provide a web address. Instead of the publisher information. The second example is an example of a report from the web. In this case, you have a group author. So it's the American Psychological Association. And by the way, when you have something like American Psychological Association, which is abbreviated as APA, you do not use the abbreviation when citing the group author. So you spell it out. If it's United Nations, you do not use UN, Use United Nations. Then you can also see that this report reference has a web address, and so there's no period at the end of it. And the third example is a journal article reference, and you can see it has multiple authors, and I'm going to show you at the end where you can look up all the details if you have more than one author because there are some permutations in there that we're not going to have time to go over right now. But in this case, you can see you have the article title, not in italics, but with the capitalization of just the first letter of the first word in the title. And then you have followed by the journal title where the article resides, that is in italics and it's capitalized normally. And then usually have the volume and issue. And it looks a little weird, but you usually have the issue in parentheses, with no space between, immediately following the volume. And then you usually have the page range of the article. And in this case, you can see it also includes a DOI web address. So you can usually tell it's a DOI when it has doi.org in the web address, right after the HTTP part. So those are some examples. Let's talk a little bit about overall APA paper formatting. And first off, if you're unsure if you need to format your entire paper in APA and not just not just the citations, ask your instructor, because keep in mind that these citation formats were not designed for things like discussion forums and non-paper assignments. So if you're unclear, ask your instructor and any guidelines they give you should apply. And they can you know, at their discretion, professors, of course, can choose to override what's in the general APA guidelines. Just like on the References page, your text should be double spaced, and you should have 1 inch margins on all sides. The page numbers should be in the top right, starting with the title page and including the references page. And there is a method in Microsoft Word to format, what's called the Header, where you can include those page numbers and format them to the right as required. And again, you can Google or search YouTube for methods and how to do that, if unsure. So in general, your paper should consist of the title page, the text or the body of your paper, and a References page. And in some, you know, more advanced cases and in formal publications, sometimes you'll have supplemental material charts and graphs and things like that, but we won't go into those details. And of course, always refer to the specific assignment instructions, as well as the APA sample papers, which I'm going to show you at the end for all these details. I've been doing this APA teaching for more than 20 years, and I can tell you that I do not have all these details memorized. I just know where to quickly look them up when the time comes to know them. All right. Let's talk a little bit about paraphrasing. Now, what is paraphrasing? It involves taking a passage, an idea or a summary of a source and putting that information into your own words and into your own sentence structure, using your own voice to describe that idea or information. Now, when you do this, even though it's in your own words, you still must also cite it both in-text and on your References page. Now, when you paraphrase, you're usually making the original passage more condensed, shorter than the original. You're taking a segment from the source and condensing it. That is one of the key factors in paraphrasing. Now, when you paraphrase, you generally need to go beyond just changing some of the words, you want to restructure and rewrite that information as completely as possible. And the key to this is when you're reading your sources, and I can't stress this enough. Take notes and jot down ideas in your own words. Don't just highlight the text, because if you take that extra step to take notes and ideas in your own words, whether it's in the margins of a printout, on a separate piece of paper or in a word document or on your phone, If you can put those things in your own words, you will have gone at least halfway into creating a paraphrase right from there. In addition, good note taking habits are the key to learning in general. So I cannot stress enough that if you don't already have a good note taking habit and writing things in your own words, that you spend some time developing that because it can help you immensely in your academic career. All right, let's look at an example. So here's an original passage from a book, an old book. It says, students frequently overuse direct quotation and taking notes. And as a result, they over used quotations in the final research paper. Probably only about 10% of your final manuscript should appear as directly quoted matter. Therefore, you should strive to limit the amount of exact transcribing of source materials while taking notes. And then there's some information there about where it's from. Let's look at some paraphrases of information from that. So here's one example. And this includes, you'll notice, the narrative in text citation formatting that we talked about earlier. Lester, 1976, argues that in research papers, students often quote excessively, failing to keep quoted material down to a desirable level closer to 10%. And then in parentheses, pages 46 through 47. Now, you notice that this is a distillation of what's in the longer passage. It condenses that information and just focuses in on the key piece of information that the person wanted to use when they created the paraphrase, which is that 10% number. Here's another example. Lester, 1976, suggests that students should take just a few notes in direct quotation from sources to help minimize the amount of quoted material in a research paper. Again, page numbers 46 through 47. Again, you'll notice that it's condensed. It's just sort of summarizing the passage and the idea within it. Now, let's finally look at an example that would probably be considered plagiarism. And in this one, it says, Lester, 1976, suggests that students often use too many direct quotations when they take notes, resulting in too many of them in the final research paper. In fact, probably only about 10% of the final copy should consist of directly quoted material. So it is important to limit the amount of source material copied while taking notes. So you may notice in looking at this that includes a proper narrative in text citation. So that isn't a problem. So why might this be considered an act of plagiarism? And the answer is that what I did when I created this last plagiarized paraphrase is that I simply took out a thesaurus and changed about half the words from the original passage. And if you compare this last paraphrase to the original passage, you'll notice it contains all the exact same sentence structure. It just changes some of the words. So when you paraphrase, Again, it's more than just changing some of the words. You want to, if at all possible. Sometimes it isn't possible, if it's a very short piece of information. But when you paraphrase, you want to condense it and change the sentence structure as much as possible. Now, you may be asking yourself at this point, why should I bother paraphrasing? And there are several reasons for this. Number one, paraphrasing is a very powerful, persuasive tool in academic writing. It's the most powerful way to leverage the evidence in your sources and weave it into your own assertions and arguments. And the best writers, the most persuasive writers use this method a lot. Secondly, And more practically, if you can take that extra step in just paraphrasing a couple of things the next time you write a paper, I can pretty much guarantee that your professor will notice, and it'll make your writing stick out to that professor. And hopefully, it might have a positive impact on the grade of that particular assignment. Finally, let's look at where in the library, you can get help with citing sources. First of all, you'll notice here on the library homepage. There is a chat with the librarian 24-7 appear in the right. And if you have questions, you can always contact a librarian to get those questions answered about citing. This is something that all students struggle with at one time or another, so don't hesitate to ask for help. For self help, and if you ask a librarian, we'll probably refer you to these materials because we won't do these citations for you. If I scroll down below the OneSearch under the Get help section in the middle column of the library, there's the first link there it says Citing and Citation Tools. So I'm going to click on that. And then there are blue tabs near the top of the page, and I'm going to click on the one for APA. And then I will see a bunch of help materials for APA. Now, I'm just going to point out a couple of important ones, but there are others, including video tutorials similar to this that you can explore if you so choose. The first link on the left side is a word template for APA student papers. And this is very helpful if you're being asked to format your entire paper in APA, because what this does is provide a already formatted word APA paper, including a title page and a references page, and you just have to take out the example material and replace it with your own writing. So it's a good way to get a head start on that formatting. The second link is the APA style guide seventh edition Owl. And this is the de facto go to for looking up APA details in on the web. And so I'm going to show you this just real briefly. If I click on it, it'll take me to the Perdue University APA Style Guide. And what you'll do is come here and use the left side menu to get all the sort of nitty gritty details that you'll not have memorized and you'll want to look up. So you can see there's two sections here for In-text citations, the basics, which you'll give you examples and things like that. And in text citations, author authors. And so if you have questions about, well, there's no author included or I have five authors, how do I format that? That's where you go for that. And then there's some sections here for reference list. And you can see there's basic rules, author authors, again, for permutations and authors and how to format that. And then you'll have sections for various types of publications. And you're going to generally here at Empire, you're probably going to be mostly using electronic sources. And so this will have examples of journal articles, web pages, ebooks, those types of things. But you can explore all those on your own. Coming back to the APA Empire page. There are some details here about doing intex citations in the APA, if you ever want to review what we've discussed. There's a Quick Tips handout that covers some of the basics that I encourage you to print out and just keep it handy if you're going to be doing a lot of writing with APA. But a really important one that a lot of students like is the APA references examples. And so I'm just going to show you this real quickly. And this is, as the name implies, it's just a list of examples in with various publication styles. So, for example, there's a section here for periodicals on journal article references, magazine and newspaper articles, book and E book references, and all sorts of other things, report by government agency, dissertations, those types of things. You can find all those examples. And what you generally want to do is find the example that most closely fits what you have in front of you. Look at the format provided, and then sub in your own materials. So you can see, you know, here's where the periods you go. Here's what needs to be in italics. Here's how things need to be capitalized. Here's how to format the author, and those types of things. You can see that and apply that to the information from your specific sources, okay? Okay. Lastly, I just want to point out that there are some sample papers with annotations explaining how things are formatted. So you can explore those to see how a paper is laid out, what a references page and a KDO page looks like fully filled out, and you can explore that as well. And there's more materials available. So that is it for siting with APA. So, just remember, you can always reach out to a librarian with any questions, and there's lots of self help materials available from the library home page as well.",Education,Child|Development,https://www.sweetstudy.com/questions/child-development-20888697

Part 2: Respond back to two students

Student #1 response: 

What are the three barriers I experience when I try to practice self-care? 
1.)  
            Procrastination/ Time Management: Time would be the biggest one for me because sometimes I never have time to take care of me. I am always working and on the weekends I have to clean my home from the past week mess and get ready for the week that is coming. Somedays i have homework that is due all on one day and it can be a bit overwhelming. If I do self-care I really have to plan it around my work schedule which is so sad. 
        
2.) 
             FEAR: I often struggle with doing things by myself. I feel like I always need someone to be with me when im doing anything honestly. That stems from childhood trauma, I'm afraid to let people go or doing things alone because I think they will leave me and never come back. I feel like if I can see them then they're safe and I'm safe. It's weird right? The last thing my mama said to me is that she would be right back and never came home. 
        
3.)  
            Mental Health: I sometimes have days where I do not get out of bed, eat, or get dressed. Some days are better than others. I feel secure in my bed and in my home but some days it's like I want to get out but I can't.
        
What  are three ways I can work around those barriers? 
· Finding new ways of self-care which I have found recently which is plants. It just does something for me. I can't really explain but it's like when I'm doing it everything I am thinking about just goes away.
· start doing things by myself. I know that it's okay to do things with friends but that attachment issue I have is not okay. I want to get into going to therapy to see if that can help me. 

Student 2:

1. What are three barriers I experience when I try to practice self-care?
· 
            Direction - I often think of self-care in the form of hobbies or leisure. I know that’s not the full extent of it, but personally, I don’t practice many hobbies. Part of that is time constraint, part is simply making the decision to take care of myself.
        
· 
            Guilt - whenever I do one thing, something goes undone. That could mean chores at home, schoolwork. I started to expand that list, but I think I can see I probably make too many excuses.
        
· 
            Community - I have great friends, but there are things that I would like to do, again leisure and hobbies, that I don’t have in common with my current community. There are some things I enjoy alone, but there are activities I would love to do with others.
        
 
2. What are three ways I can work around those barriers?
· 
            Clarity - I think I need to identify a few activities that are actually self-care. What are the essentials, and then what could be the activities that I enjoy and could add to my time.
        
· 
            Self-forgiveness - I appreciated the text giving a picture of self-forgiveness and self-compassion. I think I’m too hard on myself when I don’t complete self-care tasks, rather than just taking time to care for myself.
        
· 
            New community - I need to give myself time and find new opportunities to meet people that enjoy being together.

"Business & Finance OxMetrics: Assignment on Stock Price Modeling, Forecasting, and Testing of Three Companies Based on OxMetrics","Need assistance with an assignment that involves complex financial data analysis. The task focuses on the stock prices of three major companies - Microsoft, Samsung, and Apple - from 1990 to 2020 (or as far back as possible for Samsung, with its IPO in 1975). I have also prepared 2 samples for you to do in right form.
Assignment Requirements

Data Handling: All data must be loaded into a single data file in OxMetrics, ensuring the same time series (common dates) for cointegration analysis. Special attention has to be paid to outliers in Apple (around 2,000 observations) and Samsung (around 5,200 observations). For Samsung, the stock price data needs to be adjusted for the exchange rate, and all stock prices should be in the same unit (dollars per share). Also, any stock splits need to be accounted for by rescaling the pre - split stock values.
Modeling and Testing: A VAR model is required, along with ADF and Johansen tests to analyze the relationships and differences between the stock price series. I need the specific model results, especially the numerical output of the Johansen cointegration test and VAR estimates. Each test result should be presented as a screenshot.
Graphing: I need a separate plot for each company showing its stock price change over time, with the x - axis representing time.
Software Requirement: The entire analysis must be done using the new version of OxMetrics (version 9.30). The download link, username, password, and registration code are provided. After installation, PcGive needs to be tested for data loading and graphing.
Deliverables: The final data in OxMetrics format (either.in7/.bn7 files or.oxdata file) should be provided. Additionally, the work should be presented in a 5 - minute presentation with a maximum two - page handout, including an economic framework description, data graphs with adjustment discussions, descriptive statistics (including ADF statistics), and analysis of the relationships between the series (cointegration analysis).

Time - Sensitive Request
I'm under a lot of pressure as this assignment is due very soon. I would greatly appreciate it if someone could take on this task and complete it within 24 hours. Please let me know if you're available and have the necessary skills to handle this financial data analysis project. ",requirement1.docx|63721.xlsx|PiercePresentation21.docx|PiercePresentation2.docx,link|link|link|link,,Business & Finance,24hours|Data|Economic|Fin,https://www.sweetstudy.com/questions/business-and-finance-oxmetrics-assignment-on-stock-price-modeling-forecasting-and-testing-of-three-companies-based-on-oxmetrics

BUILDING A HEALTH HISTORY:",BUILDINGAHEALTHHISTORYCASESTUDY.docx,BUILDINGAHEALTHHISTORYCASESTUDY.docx,"BUILDINGAHEALTHHISTORYCASESTUDY.docx
BUILDING A HEALTH HISTORY: COMMUNICATING EFFECTIVELY TO GATHER APPROPRIATE HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION
Effective communication is vital to constructing an accurate and detailed patient history. A patient’s health or illness is influenced by many factors, including age, gender, ethnicity, and environmental setting. 
There may also be significant cultural factors. In May 2012, Alice Randall wrote an article for The New York Times on the cultural factors that encouraged Black women to maintain a weight above what is considered healthy. Randall explained from her observations and her personal experience, as a Black woman, that many African American communities and cultures consider women who are overweight to be more beautiful and desirable than women at a healthier weight. As she put it, “Many black women are fat because we want to be” (Randall, 2012). 
Randall’s statements sparked a great deal of controversy and debate at the time; however, they emphasize an underlying reality in the healthcare field: Different populations, cultures, and groups have diverse beliefs and practices that impact their health. APRNs and other healthcare professionals should be aware of this reality and adapt their health assessment techniques and recommendations to accommodate diversity.
As an advanced practice nurse, you must build a patient health history that takes into account all of the factors that make a patient unique and tailor your communication techniques accordingly. Doing so will not only help you establish rapport with each patient, but it will also enable you to more effectively gather the information needed to assess a patient’s health risks. 
For this first Assignment, you will take on the role of an APRN who is building a health history for a particular patient assigned by your Instructor. You will consider how social determinants of health and specific cultural considerations will influence your interview and communication techniques as you work in partnership with the patient to gather data for an accurate health history.  

To prepare:

· Reflect on your experience as an advanced practice nurse and on the information provided in the Week 1 Learning Resources on building a health history and the Week 2 Learning Resources on diversity issues in health assessments. 
· By Day 1 of this week, your Instructor will assign a case study for this Assignment. 
            Note: Please see the 
            Course Announcements section of the classroom for your Case Study Assignment. 
        
· Reflect on the specific socioeconomic, spiritual, lifestyle, and other cultural factors related to the health of your assigned patient. 
· Consider how you would build a health history for the patient. What questions would you ask? How might you target your questions based on the patient’s social determinants of health? How would you frame the questions to be sensitive to the patient’s background, lifestyle, and culture? 
· Identify any potential health-related risks, based on the patient’s age, gender, ethnicity, or environmental setting, which should be taken into consideration. 
· What risk assessment instruments would be appropriate to use with this patient? 
· What questions would you ask to assess the patient’s health risks?  
· Select 
            one (1) risk assessment instrument discussed in the Learning Resources, or another tool with which you are familiar, related to your selected patient. 
        
· Develop 
            five (5) targeted questions you would ask the patient to build their health history and to assess their health risks. 
        
· Think about the challenges associated with communicating with patients from a variety of specific populations. What communication techniques would be most appropriate to use with this patient? What strategies can you as an APRN employ to be sensitive to different cultural factors while gathering the pertinent information?

Unit Lesson 
 
Introduction 
 
We are now in Unit VIII. We have learned a lot about environmental technologies. We began with key 
principles of technologies. Then, we learned about water treatment, piping, solid waste, hazardous waste, air 
pollution, and noise pollution. This lesson will describe a case study scenario that brings together the course 
learning objectives.  
 
Scenario  
 
A fictitious company called GoodProcesses Inc. has (fictitiously) had conversations with state and local 
government officials. GoodProcesses Inc. is proposing using an existing building for its manufacturing 
process. It needs to make sure the existing piping and water treatment tanks are sufficient. It also needs to 
determine its classification under hazardous waste laws, treat gaseous emissions, and address noise 
concerns. In addition, GoodProcesses Inc. is considering building and operating a solid waste landfill and 
needs to determine if there is enough land at its selected location. 
 
Piping system: GoodProcesses Inc. plans to purchase an old industrial facility for a manufacturing process. 
The old facility has an elevated tank that is open to atmospheric pressure that delivers water through a pipe to 
a process at atmospheric pressure but at a lower elevation than the tank. The existing pipe is an 8-inch 
diameter iron water pipe that has an elevation drop of 1.25 feet over its 250 foot length. GoodProcesses Inc.

needs to determine if the pipe will carry the 300 gpm of water that they need for its manufacturing process. 
The flow rate is shown below (Nathanson & Schneider, 2015, p. 33). 
 
 𝑄𝑄 = 0.28 𝐶𝐶 𝐷𝐷2.63𝑆𝑆0.54  

 
Q = Flow rate, gpm (gallons per minute) 
C= Hazen-Williams Coefficient 
D = Pipe inside diameter, inch 
S = Slope of hydraulic grade line, dimensionless

0.54

= 380 gpm 
 

 
Since the flow rate required is 300 gpm and the pipe can deliver 380 gpm, the existing pipe is adequate. 
 
Water treatment: GoodProcesses Inc. needs to filter the suspended sediment out of the water so that the 
water is clean enough to use for its manufacturing process. There is an existing rapid sand filter in the facility 
that has an area (looking down on it since water flows through it vertically) of 180 ft2. Is this area sufficient to 
process the desired flow rate of 300 gpm? 
 
From Nathanson and Schneider (2015), a rapid sand filter effectively operates at 2 gpm/ft2 where the ft2 
represents the cross-sectional area (looking down) on the tank holding the sand. A 180 ft2 tank can process 
the flow rate of dirty water shown below. 
 
 𝑄𝑄 = 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅  

 
Q = Flow rate, gpm 
R = Design filtration rate = 2 gpm/ft2  
A = Tank (filter) area = 180 ft2 
 
Therefore, the equation is as shown below. 
 
 𝑄𝑄 = �2

gpm
ft2

� (180 ft2) = 360 gpm  

 
The rapid sand filter can process 360 gpm, which shows that it is sufficiently large and will easily process the 
required 300 gpm. 
 
Hazardous waste: GoodProcesses Inc. realizes that it will generate hazardous waste from its manufacturing 
process. However, the company is hopeful that it will be classified as a conditionally exempt small-quantity 
generator. A conditionally exempt small-quantity generator generates less than 100 kg of hazardous waste 
per month (Nathanson & Schneider, 2015, p. 322). Though GoodProcesses Inc. knows its processes, it is not 
well versed on what exactly constitutes hazardous waste. Thus, the company has hired an environmental firm 
to compute its hazardous waste generation. The environmental firm computed a hazardous waste generation 
rate of 0.2 kg for each hour that GoodProcesses Inc.'s manufacturing process is in operation. GoodProcesses 
Inc. plans to operate the process 16 hours per 24-hour period on weekdays but not at all on weekends.

The amount of hazardous waste generated per month is shown below.

Therefore, the equation is as shown below. 
 
 𝐻𝐻 = 𝑅𝑅 𝑇𝑇𝑀𝑀 = �

Therefore, GoodProcesses Inc. is a conditionally exempt small-quantity generator since 69.3 kg/month is less 
than 100 kg/month. 
 
Air pollution control: As a part of its pollution prevention plan, GoodProcesses Inc.'s management has a 
goal of removing 90% of its particulate matter from its gaseous stream that flows at 140 m3/s during process 
operation. GoodProcesses Inc. has hired an engineering firm to determine how best to achieve the 90% goal. 
The engineering firm determined that an electrostatic precipitator would be the most cost-effective option for 
the company’s process. To size the electrostatic precipitator's plate, the following equation is used 
(Nathanson & Schneider, 2015, p. 380). 
 
 

𝐸𝐸 = 100 �1 − 𝑒𝑒
−𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤
𝑄𝑄 � 



 
E = Percent removal efficiency = 90% 
w = Effective drift velocity 
A = Total collector plate area 
Q = Gas flow rate of gas through the electrostatic precipitator = 140 m3/s 
 
The effective drift velocity is a design value set by the manufacturer of the electrostatic precipitator. The 
manufacturer indicates a value of w=0.1 m/s. 
 
The above equation is algebraically rearranged to solve for A. 
 
 𝐸𝐸

Then, the equation would be represented as shown below.

The engineering firm suggests that GoodProcesses Inc. should purchase an electrostatic precipitator that has 
an area of at least 3223 m2 in order to achieve 90% removal of particulate matter. 
 
Production of noise: GoodProcesses, Inc. realizes that it must also address potential noise issues. The 
company wants to make sure that it does not exceed 80 dB (decibels) for its loudest process after using 
cushioning, mufflers, and enclosures to reduce noise. Considering all of the equipment in the building and the 
noise protection measures, the loudest process is rated to put out 1.5 μbar of sound pressure. 
GoodProcesses Inc. has staff that are able to convert the sound pressure rating to dB. The safety department 
uses the equation below (Nathanson & Schneider, 2015, p. 391). 
 
 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 = 20  log �

𝑆𝑆
𝑆𝑆𝑜𝑜
�  

 
log = Common (base 10) logarithm 
SPL = Sound pressure level, dB 
P = Sound pressure = 1.5 μbar 
Po = Reference sound pressure = 0.0002 μbar 
 
Therefore, the SPL from the 1.5 μbar process is as shown below. 
 
 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 = 20 log �

1.5 μbar
0.0002 μbar

� = 77.5 dB  

 
Since 77.5 dB is less than 80 dB, GoodProcesses Inc. has achieved its goal of having 80 dB or less noise for 
its loudest process. 
 
Solid waste: In addition to operating its own manufacturing facility, the management of GoodProcesses Inc. 
has been in conversations with the state’s environmental protection agency about constructing a new landfill. 
The site that the company would like to use has an area of 150 acres for the waste, plus additional land area 
for buildings and buffer zones. If the landfill is to serve an average population of 60,000 people for 30 years 
and the depth of the landfill is 25 ft, will the available land area be sufficient?

From Nathanson and Schneider (2015), the following design values are helpful (p. 310). 
 
R = Rate of waste generation per person = 5 pounds per person per day = 5 lb/person-day

Designing an Inclusive and Effective Assessment Plan for a Diverse Middle School Mathematics Class


School and Student Population Description

This assessment plan is relevant to a suburban-based middle school with a total student enrollment of 1200 students. The students are also diverse in terms of their socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds; 45% are Hispanic, 35% are white, 15% are Black, and less than 5% are Asian or belong to any other race. 12% of the students require special education services, and 20% of them are enrolled with ELL (English as a second language) status (Appiah-Odame, 2). Some of the ways through which it ensures that it supports equality are by offering several resources and opportunities that will cater to both the academic and social aspects.
Thus, using diagnostic assessments, it was revealed that the students are deficient. in their abilities to apply the formal knowledge and skills to solve complex analytical as well as practical tasks. Also, the students are able to perform well in practical activities as well as teamwork. These strengths and challenges are incorporated into this assessment plan of equitably applying the skills in practical group activities with feedback systems (Dixson and Worrell, 3).

Promoting Learning and an Inclusive Environment

This assessment plan helps to create the inclusive learning environment in which all the students will be able to reach their potential through the variety of the assessment submission and getting through options provided in accordance with their learning styles. Through the incorporation of formative quizzes and project assignments, as well as peer and self-assessments, it is considered that all students have an equal chance to show mastery in different manners. Different students, especially the visual, auditory, and movers, require certain activities to learn most of what is taught in class.
In an assessment for learning context, students are grouped to be taught in different groups based on the results of formative assessment. Peer and self-assessment is beneficial to the social-emotional learning process since it brings out the issues of self-awareness, self-reflection, and responsibilities held by the classmates. Besides, this plan also stresses practicality, which enhances the understanding of concepts as well as the performance of those students who may experience difficulties with the theoretical part. These include the state’s pupil improvement plans and any long-term state plans that may impact education in order to increase effectiveness for ELL and special ed students (Angelo and Zakrajsek, 1).

Assessment Plan Overview

The system of seven-week grading periods is designed considering the important learning objectives; each week is dedicated to the growth of both the academic and the practical experience. The area of specialization is mathematics, and the plan complies with the CCSS and local learning objectives. The imposed Objectives therein include place value, pattern, and solving real-life problems.

General Learning Target

The main concept here is to achieve the improvement of students’ mathematical skills, their ability to reason and think critically, and to solve problems in teams. They are mastering place value, pattern usage, and generalization. These are the involvements of these concepts in handling budgets and other quantifiable data.

Timeframe and Objectives

Here below is the timetable set for the various objectives to be achieved in each. week.

Week 1-2: Understanding place value (CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.NBT.A.1)
        

Week 3-4: Recognizing and generating patterns (CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.OA.B.3)
        

Week 5-7: Integration—using the materials of the course and demonstrating mathematical concepts in the context of group tasks and projects on keeping and managing budgets.
        

Assessment Techniques

It consists of three major approaches to assessment that aim at evaluating as well as enhancing students’ learning. These motivate different intelligences. and come with provisions for practice and learning from one’s strengths and areas that require improvements.

1. Formative Quizzes


Description: Quizzes are short and not high-stakes quizzes, as they are meant to check the understanding of number kingdom concepts such as place value and pattern recognition.
        

Purpose: The primary intent of formative assessment is used to give an instant response that will help the teacher and students to determine strong points and the ones that a learner is lacking.
        

Student Activities: Students will be tested weekly and choose the type of questions, like multiple-choice or short answer, for the week’s lesson objectives.
        

Follow-Up: Teachers shall analyze the quiz. performance and conclude from it the areas of misunderstanding, specifically in JK, which needs to be redressed in the subsequent lessons.
        

Rationale: Evidence proves that such quizzes enhance recall and detection of knowledge gaps in a relaxed, non-high-stakes environment (Dixson and Worrell, 3).
        

Inclusion Strategies: Quizzes will come in different categories, where some will involve the use of diagrams and some will involve the use of number problems.
        

2. Project-Based Assessment


Description: As a part of team endeavors, students have to incorporate the concepts of mathematics to solve problems. For instance, the students will be expected to prepare a budget for a school program.
        

Purpose: To be able to demonstrate academic concepts and apply them to practice by solving problems, putting into consideration the elements of thinking critically, innovatively, and in groups.
        

Student Activities: Students will be placed in groups so they can design a project, estimate costs, and present the solutions to the class.
        

Follow-Up: Teachers will give the kind of feedback where they assign the rubric for creativity, accuracy, and especially for the problem-solving part. In this case, it will be the duty of the students. to use the feedback given to them by their instructors to make the necessary corrections to their work.
        

Rationale: This strategy will help to involve students because they can relate what they are taught in class to real-life issues. Contribution is also made to transferable skills like teamwork and finance skills (Appiah-Odame, 2).
        

Inclusion Strategies: Every student will be free to disseminate the knowledge by reporting in the chosen formats based on students’ advantages and preferences.
        

3. Peer and Self-Assessment


Description: In this learning activity, students are given a set of guidelines to assess their own and their group's members’ performances in the completion of an assigned group project.
        

Purpose: To monitor and encourage others as a means of following up on one’s/their actions and to learn how to provide constructive feedback.
        

Student Activities: Under teamwork, after several group assignments have been accomplished, the students will fill in a self-evaluation form and evaluate their colleagues as well.
        

Follow-Up: For instance, teachers will also organize discussion meetings aimed at reviewing the students’ assessments and establishing personal performance enhancements.
        

Rationale: Peer and self-assessment motivate learners to have ownership of the learning, and it also offers multiple viewpoints on performance.
        

Inclusion Strategies: The teachers will facilitate the tests and offer guidance that will help all student who may be having challenges with communication to be able to record good results.
        

Grade Weights

There is also the following division in terms of the plan of grading: formative and summative assessments help one get the overall picture of the student progress.

Formative Quizzes: 20% of the final grade
        

Project-Based Assessments: 50% of the final grade
        

Peer and Self-Assessments: 30% of the final grade
        
This distribution of workload ensures that every person is working and everyone is held responsible for their work as well as encouraging teamwork and professionalism.

Assessment Plan for One Unit (Weeks 5-7)

The unit under discussion is the one that uses place value and different forms of patterns while solving real-life problems, such as budgeting. This unit has been designed in such a way that students will have to come up with a group project that will reflect their understanding of some of the lessons learned in mathematics.

Assessment Technique 1: Quizzes on place value and pattern recognition
        

Assessment Technique 2: Collaborative project on budgeting
        

Assessment Technique 3: Peer and self-assessments of group work
        
These forms of assessments have many purposes, showing that students can be assessed. at various phases of the project academically.

Strategies for Inclusion

The assessment plan to be employed addresses the needs of a diverse population so that all the students may be facilitated to study. The facets of differentiation instruction and multiple-choice formats for the assessment, as well as culturally relevant approaches, assist in meeting the diverse students’ needs. Other students that get help include ELL students who get help through the use of visual instruction and scaffolding, and special education students get help since they have individual needs.

Conclusion

This assessment plan is rather balanced to gauge the learning achievement of the students, eliciting students’ involvement as well as accommodating students with disabilities. Through the adoption of multiple assessment approaches, it becomes easier for teachers to identify the learning inputs and requirements as well as the learning outcomes of the learners that they teach. Other teachers can hence adopt this plan by only changing the content and the assessment strategies to their area of teaching and the specific objectives of the course. Student interaction as part of their learning and the emphasis on practical application make it possible for students to prepare for classroom work as well as real-life situations.

The Psychiatric Evaluation and Evidence-Based Rating Scales

Assessment tools have two primary purposes: 1) to measure illness and diagnose clients, and 2) to measure a client’s response to treatment. Often, you will find that multiple assessment tools are designed to measure the same condition or response. Not all tools, however, are appropriate for use in all clinical situations. You must consider the strengths and weaknesses of each tool to select the appropriate assessment tool for your client. For this Discussion, as you examine the assessment tool assigned to you by the Course Instructor, consider its use in psychotherapy.

discussion:   The purpose of this assignment is for... | Psychology," 
The purpose of this assignment is for students to identify and discuss different leadership theories exemplified in business leaders. Students will also describe power bases leaders use to resolve challenges and explain behaviors that leaders should demonstrate or avoid in order to be successful. Specifically, identify one business leader you either know personally or are able to gain access to for the purpose of conducting an interview who meets the following criteria:

The leader may be a former or current manager, educational leader, civic/business leader (including for nonprofits), coaching staff, or religious leader.
The leader must have served in a managerial capacity for at least 3 years within an organization or department with at least 10 employees.
The leader may refer to their current job or a previous job as long as the experience meets the criteria noted above.
Please note that your chosen leader must first be approved by your instructor if you have not already received approval prior to starting this topic. 

This interview can take place virtually over video conference (e.g., Zoom) or in person. For assistance on using Zoom and recording with Zoom, which you will need for Part III of this assignment, refer to the ""Zoom"" resources information, located in the Topic 6 Resources.
Part I: Preparing for and Conducting the Interview
In advance of the interview, be sure to read and understand the presentation guidelines below and be prepared to ask additional/follow-up questions to ensure that information adequate enough to address each point has been retrieved. For example, you would not necessarily want to ask a leader about the power base(s) they have utilized, as they may not know what you are talking about, but you will want to have enough information pertaining to how the leader handled their challenge to articulate which power base(s) you believe they used.
Additionally, refer the attached ""Contemporary Business Leader Materials"" template prior to the interview to review the skills and characteristics associated with servant leadership and the entrepreneurial mindset. Use the first three worksheet tabs of this ""Contemporary Business Leader Materials"" template to automatically calculate the scores your leaders receive for each concept. Note that during the interview, you will walk through these assessments with the interviewee and fill it out as you talk through the questions together. Do not give the template to the interviewee and expect them to fill it out independently. 
Evidence of the Interview and Conducting the Interview
As you conduct the interview, take thorough notes. Your supporting documentation should reflect a brief response of a minimum of two to three sentences for each question covered. You will see that the ""Contemporary Business Leader Materials"" template contains a section for you to include your notes. 
As an alternative option, you may record the interview instead of taking physical notes so that you may refer back to it as you complete the remaining parts of the assignment. Students must receive permission from the interviewee to record the interview. The recording (audio or video) can be submitted in lieu of written notes via a sharable link. 
In addition to your own insights, note that throughout the PowerPoint slides and the speaker notes, you will need to provide cited documentation to justify any factual statements made and to support your positions. Review ""Assignment Submission Guidelines,"" located in the Class Resources. Remember that PDFs are not an acceptable format.  
Address all of the following questions with your interviewee:
Background Information:
Address the basics with your interviewee:

Who are you?
Where do you work? How long have you been there in your role?

Interview Topics: 
Reflect upon either your current job or a previous one:

Which industry is/was representative of the organization, what is/was your role, and how long have you been or were you in that position?
Consider your greatest career achievement in that role. Provide details, including the time period and the persons, products, and services involved. What management principles, strategies, or processes did you employ that you believe led to this effective organizational outcome? Why do you consider this achievement to have been so impactful? Refer to ""1. Part A - Servant Leadership"" of the ""Contemporary Business Leader Materials"" template and rate each characteristic that your interviewee used in realizing their greatest achievement. Please provide an example.
Consider one significant challenge, preferably one with an ethical dilemma, you previously faced in that role. How did you handle it, and what was the outcome? Provide details including the time period, persons, products, services, competition, market conditions, etc. that may have been involved. Refer to ""2. Part B - Servant Leadership"" of the ""Contemporary Business Leader Materials"" template and rate each characteristic that your interviewee used in overcoming their significant challenge. Please provide an example.
What was the mission, vision, and strategy of the organization, and how were they accomplished? How essential is the entrepreneurial mindset in achieving the mission, vision, and strategy of the organization? Refer to ""3. Part C - Entrepreneurial Mindset"" of the ""Contemporary Business Leader Materials"" template and rate each trait that your interviewee used in demonstrating an entrepreneurial mindset. Please provide an example.
Apart from servant leadership and the entrepreneurial mindset, please identify two significant lessons/attributes that are essential for success. Describe anything you wish you would have specifically avoided that may have derailed or delayed your success?

Deliverables:
The following deliverables will need to be included in your final submission for this part of the assignment within the ""Contemporary Business Leader Materials"" template for these four tabs. 

Part A - Servant Leadership
Part B - Servant Leadership
Part C - Entrepreneurial Mindset
Evidence of the Interview

Part II: Leadership Comparison
In preparation for Part III, you will conduct research to compare the leadership style used by your selected leader (interviewed in Part I) with the style of a well-known business leader from the attached ""Contemporary Business Leader Materials"" template in the ""6. Comparison Leaders List"" tab. Your selected leader should be in the same industry (e.g., technology, finance, hospitality, etc.) as the leader chosen for comparison. Investigate the strengths and weaknesses of both leadership styles. Your analysis will be presented in the ""Leadership Style Comparison"" and ""Leadership Lessons"" sections of the Part III: Presentation.
If you would like to compare your leader to a leader not provided on the ""6. Comparison Leaders List"" tab, the selection must first be approved by your instructor.
Part III: Presentation
Create a PowerPoint presentation of 10-12 slides (including a title slide and references slide) and then record a video presentation using Zoom, sharing your screen with the slides showing and also with at least your face showing as you present. Note that points will be deducted for audio-only submissions. Make sure to keep the following details in mind for your submission:

Given that you are required to have 10-12 slides, the time for the video should be about 10-12 minutes, so there will be a point deduction for going above or below that range.
As the digital classroom does not support large file sizes, you will need first save your Zoom recording and create a digital link. Refer to ""Zoom,"" located in the Topic 6 Resources for specific guidance on this process. When you receive the link, embed it into the title slide of your presentation, which you will upload to the digital classroom.
All content slides must include developed speaker notes in which you fully explain your ideas presented on the slides.

The first seven sections outlined below are based upon your interview above in Part I in addition to your corresponding research. Address the following in your presentation under the appropriate headings:

The Bible describes a variety of crimes which are still pertinent today which hold both a legal and moral significance within our communities, and shape how we interpret modern crime with biblical references. Aside from Murder, two additional examples include both theft and perjury, which are still punishable today in a modernized criminal justice system. With both criminal statutes, we can examine the biblical elements associated and compare them to our modernized laws- which allows for us to see its relevance with regard to contemporary law.

For starters, the eighth commandment stated, ""You shall not steal"" (Exodus 20:15, ESV), which establishes that theft is a sin in biblical law. Stealing, i.e. theft is elaborated in Exodus as well, specifically 22:1-4 where it outlines the restitution requirements for any products or goods which were stolen. The various elements of theft within biblical law include the unlawful taking, with intent to deprive the owner, with restitution as a penalty or sentence.

In the State of Georgia, where I am employed in law enforcement, theft is codified under O.C.G.A. 16-8-2, which defines theft by taking as unlawfully taking or appropriating property with the intent to deprive the owner of possession. Unlike how biblical law is written, Georgia law primarily focuses on the punishment associates rather than any restitution for said offense, with the penalties varying from the amount stolen. Our statutes reference theft as a misdemeanor where lesser amounts of $1,500 is a misdemeanor, while any theft that exceeds $1,500 is a felony (O.C.G.A. 16-8-12). Georgia also breaks theft down into various subsections, such as theft by taking, theft by shoplifting, etc.

When referencing theft from a cultural standpoint, I believe that theft should remain a crime, as the property rights to ones belongings help to maintain social order within our communities. Although, our modernized legal systems could benefit from potentially incorporating restitution-based justice within certain cases, which reflects the biblical principle of compensatory justice- rather than the party having to pursue any losses via a civil court proceeding.

Secondly, perjury, or false testimony, is condemned in Exodus 20:16, ""You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor"" (ESV). When perjury is referenced in biblical law, it is taken very seriously, which Deuteronomy 19:18-19 supports by referencing how if a witness falsely accuses another, they shall receive the punishment which was initially intended for the accused party. In the State of Georgia, perjury is referenced under O.C.G.A. 16-10-70, which criminalizes knowingly making a false statement, under oath, within a judicial proceeding. With such, a conviction could lead to imprisonment for up to ten years. The primary difference between both biblical and modern law is that biblical justice demands that there is an equivalent punishment for false witnesses, where again, modern law imposes a fixed penalty, if convicted. Furthermore, truthful testimony is essential for justice. Strict enforcement of perjury should continue, potentially with harsher penalties for cases which could lead to a wrongful conviction.

Both the statute of theft and perjury are both crimes which are still relevant today, where biblical law focuses on restitution and proportionate response, whereas modern laws focus on more punitive measures. If the system begins to incorporate biblical principles like restitution, and ensures truthful testimony, I believe both the religious and secular legal systems would improve greatly.",Criminal,Db,https://www.sweetstudy.com/questions/wk7-db-replies

The first two stages relate to preparation and information exchange. Additionally, you will be gaining insight into your authentic self in the negotiation process, practicing behaviors for building greater other awareness, and refining your use of negotiation tools.
  
Week 3

Preparation and Information Sharing

Evaluate responses to the SFQs.


Create a price matrix or a similar resource matrix (if the primary issue of the negotiation is not related to price).


Analyze a zone of possible agreement by projecting a price or resource matrix for the other party and integrating it with the student's price or resource matrix.


Evaluate a best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA) for both parties and analyze ways to strengthen your BATNA and weaken the other party's BATNA.


Analyze the various interests for both parties, the data that emerges from the information-sharing phase of the negotiations, and how the interests and data might contribute to a collaborative outcome.



 Preparation and Information Sharing
Tasks:

Begin this segment of your final project with a one-paragraph introduction that summarizes the negotiation scenario, purpose, and participants.


 
Provide a one- to two-page evaluation of responses to the seven fundamental questions (SFQs) (detailed earlier in the course material) for your negotiation scenario.


 
Provide a one-page assessment of a price matrix for your role (e.g., buyer) in the negotiation. How did you determine the various pieces of your matrix? If the primary issues of the negotiation are not related to a price, provide a resource matrix of the primary issues. You      may include a chart or a table as part of your presentation of a price matrix.


 
Provide a one-page analysis of the zone of possible agreement for the negotiation by projecting a price or resource matrix for the other party in the negotiation and integrating it with the price matrix for your role. How did you determine the other party's matrix? You may include a chart or a table as part of your presentation of the zone of possible agreements


 
Evaluate a best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA) for both parties, including a discussion of the processes you used to determine the BATNAs. Also, analyze possible ways to strengthen your BATNA and to weaken the other party's BATNA. Assess the leverage available in the negotiation. Your discussion of BATNAs should be one to two pages.


 
Finally, analyze the information-sharing process in the negotiation. How was information shared? What was the climate of the information-sharing stage? What were the various interests and the data that emerged from the information exchange, and how might they impact the negotiation process and the potential outcome? What information was not shared, and how does that impact the negotiation process and outcome? The discussion of      information sharing should be two to three pages.

Discuss differences in the AUDIT tool and the AUDIT-C tool. 


The AUDIT tool stands for alcohol use disorders identification test and AUDIT- C stands for alcohol use disorders identification test-consumption. Both of these tools are designed to screened for alcohol use and to identify individuals who may be at higher risk of alcohol related problems however they differ in their scope and depth. The audit tool consists of 10 questions that cover 3 areas that are alcohol consumption, alcohol dependence, alcohol related problems. On the other hand, AUD IT-C tool is a shorter version of UD IT tool. This tool only has three questions and focuses only on alcohol consumption (Van Gils et al., 2021)
            .


Since AUD IT-C scale is Shortened it takes then 2 minutes to conduct an assessment which makes it useful for quick testing in emergency situations and in primary care. EAUDIT scale is often used for comprehensive screening of alcohol that is used in wide range of settings that may include clinical and research and environment (Van Gils et al., 2021)
            .


Briefly, what are pros and cons of using AUDIT-C vs. full AUDIT instrument?


As mentioned earlier AUD IT tool is comprehensive assessment that provides us with a better picture of and individuals alcohol use and what potential problems may be associated with the alcohol use. The AUD 82 also has the benefit of detecting risky drinking behaviors and alcohol dependence which could be negative and harmful behavior towards the patient. Given the AUDIT tool is comprehensive it could be used in variety of clinical and non-clinical situations. Because AUDIT 2 is comprehensive it takes longer to complete the assessment as compared to AUD IT-C to which typically takes 2 minutes compared to 10 minutes with AUDIT two. Due to comprehensive nature of the AUDIT tool the extended questions may be overwhelming for the patients (Van Gils et al., 2021)
            .


The AUD IT-C tool is brief which gives it an advantage as it can be administered within two minutes to screen in situations such as emergency settings. The AUDIT tool has the potential to recognize risky drinking behaviors such as binge drinking or excessive alcohol consumption. The limitations of AUDIT-C are that it misses alcohol dependence and alcohol related harm due to its brief assessment. Another factor to consider is that AUDITC scale may often produce a false negative presentation of individuals with drinking problems (Van Gils et al., 2021)
            .

Angelica, 

Discuss differences in the AUDIT tool and the AUDIT-C tool. 

The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test—Consumption (AUDIT-C) are screening tools for patients to help determine if they have an alcohol use disorder or dependence and are at risk for developing an alcohol use disorder. Both focus on frequency and quantity. AUDIT-C focuses on whether the drinking is hazardous and the severity of alcohol use and abuse.  AUDIT consists of 10 questions that are asked to the patients to determine if they have an alcohol use disorder. AUDIT-C is a condensed, 3-question version of AUDIT. AUDIT scoring ranges from 0 to 40, with 0 to 7 points being low risk, 8 to 15 points being medium risk, 16 to 19 points being high risk, and 20 to 40 points being addition is likely. AUDIT-C scoring ranges from 0 to 12; age is a factor and varies from man to woman. For example, for men, 0 to 3 points is low risk, moderate risk is 4-5 points, high risk is 6-7 points, and severe risk is 8 to 12 points. Age is also considered, as men 29 and younger are considered in the 47th to 86th percentile based on their risks,  whereas men 30 years old and older are in the 77th to 96th percentile (Franck et al., 2021).

Briefly, what are pros and cons of using AUDIT-C vs. full AUDIT instrument?

The benfits of AUDIT-C is that it is shorter, good predictor and more accurate of heavy drinking, and helps to better determine if a person will be hospitalized due to alcohol-related reasons, however, it is not as effective as AUDIT at detecting current alcohol dependence and abuse (Van Gils et al., 2021).

Jenkins Goes Abroad Case (Modified - C) 

Jenkins Consulting is a national firm based in Boston, MA, that helps companies 
improve their performance and effectiveness by advising on all aspects of business 
management and operations. Companies hire consultants from Jenkins Consulting for 
various projects, such as assisting with company-wide cost reduction initiatives, 
revenue growth initiatives, improving supply-chain management, and/or improving 
individual departments such as information technology. Jenkins employs consultants in 
25 offices across the United States. 

A company located in Delhi, India has asked Jenkins to take on a significant project that 
will be based in Delhi but will require semi-annual trips of about 2 weeks to Mumbai. 
Jenkins will assist the company with an organization-wide effort to restructure and 
reposition the company to succeed in a market that is becoming highly competitive. To 
undertake this project, Jenkins will open an office in Delhi and assign five full-time 
management consultants for a term of two years. Jenkins has decided to relocate the 
consultants selected initially to Delhi for the project's duration. Because Jenkins sees 
this assignment as an opportunity to expand its operations internationally, Jenkins will 
also hire a local national as an Office Manager to answer the phone, prepare 
documents, file related paperwork, and be a source of local knowledge to the 
consultants. 

Dale Kugar, the human resource director at Jenkins, must identify the consultants for 
this project and prepare them to transition to this new assignment within the next 60 
days. This is the company's first exposure to expatriate management. Hence, Kugar 
intends to select the first wave of consultants from the Boston office to have better 
control over Jenkins' first overseas venture. However, he is concerned about the 
consultants' interest in taking on the international assignment. Some of the consultants 
with whom he has had initial conversations are concerned about the impact the 
assignment might have on their families and their careers. As one consultant put it, ""Out 
of sight; out of mind!"" 

In addition to selecting the right persons for the expatriate positions, Kugar wants to 
ensure that the consultants who accept the assignment are compensated appropriately. 
The compensation package needs to ensure that the expatriates are not concerned 
about financial matters during their assignment but also minimize costs to Jenkins. He 
initially thought to maintain their current benefits, including health care insurance, 401(k) 
retirement plan, vacation, and related benefits, but to alter the compensation. The two 
issues he needs clarification on are how to develop a compensation package that 
considers other aspects of pay and ensuring that the consultants are not disadvantaged 
professionally by taking the assignment in Delhi. All the potential expatriates Kugar has 
talked to thus far are not married, which would likely make the assignment less costly to 




the company and less stressful for the consultants selected. However, it is possible that, 
in the end, he will have to consider married consultants, as well, to achieve the number 
needed for the assignment. 

Questions: 

1. As the HR director for Jenkins, what factors should Kugar consider in his 
selection of consultants for the assignment? What external influences and 
data should Kugar consider when preparing for these expat assignments? 
 

2. What are the various compensation approaches that Kugar can consider for 
this first wave of Jenkins expatriates? 
 

3. Of the various compensation approaches available to Kugar, which approach 
should he recommend regarding how to compensate these expatriates? What 
factors influenced your decision? 
 

4. Should Kugar provide any additional compensation or benefits to the 
expatriates as part of their total compensation package? If yes, what should 
he provide? What factors will influence his decision? 
 

5. What can Kugar do to ensure that these expatriates are not hurt career-wise 
by participating in this 2-year expat assignment? 
 

6. What factors must Kugar consider in developing a pay package for the Office 
Manager's position in Delhi? Propose a detailed salary and benefits package 
for this position. Explain the rationale for your proposed compensation 
package. 

 
While these questions should be addressed in your analysis, DO NOT merely respond 
to the six questions presented above. Your submitted assignment should address these 
questions in an integrated essay or report format. The title page, headings, citations,

Case Scenario: Juan and Bianca are a middle aged couple of Latino descent. The couple has 2 children, both away at college. Juan and Bianca were referred by their priest for counseling, due to Bianca’s history of depression and suicidal ideation. Bianca tells you, “life has always been a struggle for me. I was raised by my grandmother who tried to protect me, but I was molested many times as a little girl. I’ve often wanted to end my life, but my religious beliefs don’t allow me to”.  Bianca does report periods of joy and happiness in her life, especially regarding her children. She admits that during the last 5 years, she has had a few periods where she has actually felt euphoric, energized and elated with life. These times are brief and infrequent and, “I return to that suffocating place of despair.” She describes her husband as, “a good man. I don’t know why he has stayed with me all these years.”  Juan is very supportive of his wife, but his worry about her has resulted in exhaustion, missing work and obsessively checking that all the kitchen knives are accounted for. He tells you that, “sometimes Bianca cries out in her sleep and I don’t know how to help her.  I worry that she will do something to end her life during one of these night terrors. Even though she’s never tried, what if it happens and I’m not able to stop her.”
        


Directions: Consider Mood, Anxiety, OCD, and Trauma Related Disorders
        

1.     Taking into account the genetic, neurobiological, sociocultural, familial and environmental factors of assessment and diagnosis, what are your diagnostic thoughts for Bianca? What about Juan? Use the 
            DSM-5 criteria to formulate your diagnostic impressions for Bianca and Juan, supporting what you see in the vignette that supports your diagnostic impressions.
        

2.     Using the psychotherapeutic and pharmacological interventions discussed in the text, describe an initial treatment plan for Bianca and Juan. Remember to treat the 
            persons in the vignette, and not the diagnosis. Also remember to consider culture and legal/ethical issues.
        

3. Given the diagnosis you have made, describe your medication treatment strategies. Discuss not only initial choices of medications but also your next-step strategy and why you’ve chosen it. (In doing so, be sure to provide a rationale for your choices.) What questions should be addressed about the class of medications that is chosen (e.g., mood stabilizers)?

Descriptive Epidemiology: Data Sources and Data Collection



Descriptive epidemiology deals with describing disease patterns using three major categories: person, place, or time (Friis & Sellers, 2021). Consider the following example:
Over the last weekend, six people went to the Alcan City Hospital emergency room with similar symptoms. The laboratory results for the six patients were indicative of an infection due to Escherichia coli (E. coli). Patient interviews revealed they had all eaten a meal at Sam’s Sandwich Food Truck during the Alcan City Fair within 48 hours of going to
the hospital. Further inquiries by the Alcan City public health officials identified that the source of the E. coli contamination was the lettuce that Sam’s had purchased from M&L Produce (a produce supplier located in Tempe, Arizona). Epidemiologists from the Arizona State Health Department determined that the lettuce that M&L supplied Sam’s was from a farm located in Xion, California (the key supplier for M&L Produce).
Aside from the six patients who sought treatment, epidemiologists tracked down and conducted interviews with 400 of the fair attendees to identify any potential cases who did not seek treatment and compare data with those who attended but did not become ill. Interview questions pertained to descriptive aspects of the outbreak (person, place, and time). Analysis of data collected on foods eaten allowed the epidemiologists to narrow it down and identify sandwiches served by Sam’s
Sandwich Food Truck at the fair on Saturday as the source of infection. Alcan City public health officials were quick to visit the food truck to inquire into their food management and handling. The food truck owner was cooperative and helpful in providing licensing, permits, operations, and sales information.
Descriptive epidemiologic studies are often conducted as precursors to analytic studies. Epidemiologic concepts are used to gather data to better understand and evaluate health trends in populations. Data, such as characteristics of the persons affected, place where an incident occurred, and time of occurrence, are collected and analyzed to look for patterns in an effort to identify emerging health problems. It was in just this way that the HIV/AIDS epidemic was first identified.
In this Discussion, you will apply the epidemiologic concepts of time, place, and person to a specific population health problem. You will also consider methods for obtaining data to study an issue.

Epidemiologic Analysis of Type 2 Diabetes in Adults

Type 2 diabetes is a significant public health issue that has been increasing globally. It occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or does not produce enough insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels. Using the 
            epidemiologic model, this disease can be described based on 
            person, place, and time:
        
· 
            Person: Type 2 diabetes mostly affects 
            adults aged 45 and older, but in recent years, younger individuals, including teenagers, have also been diagnosed due to rising obesity rates. Individuals with risk factors such as 
            obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity, genetic predisposition, and underlying health conditions like hypertension are more likely to develop this disease. Socioeconomic factors also play a role, as low-income populations may have 
            less access to healthcare, healthy food, and opportunities for physical activity.
        
· 
            Place: Type 2 diabetes is prevalent worldwide, but the highest rates are found in countries with 
            high obesity rates and sedentary lifestyles. It is common in urban areas where fast food consumption is high and physical activity is low. In contrast, rural populations with limited healthcare access also experience high diabetes rates due to lack of awareness and medical support. Studies show that regions with 
            limited grocery stores and more processed food options contribute to higher diabetes risks.
        
· 
            Time: The incidence of Type 2 diabetes has 
            steadily increased over the past few decades, mainly due to changing lifestyles, increased processed food consumption, and sedentary behaviors. It is also a 
            chronic disease, meaning once diagnosed, individuals must manage it for life. Certain times of the
        
· year, such as the holiday season, may lead to an increase in blood sugar levels due to excessive eating and reduced activity.
· 
            Sampling Methods for Primary Data Collection

· To effectively study and describe Type 2 diabetes in a specific population, different 
            sampling methods can be used:
        
· 
            Stratified Sampling – This method divides the population into subgroups based on characteristics such as 
            age, BMI, ethnicity, and lifestyle. Researchers can then collect data from each subgroup to ensure a representative sample. This method helps compare risk factors across different groups.
        
· 
            Convenience Sampling – This method collects data from 
            patients visiting hospitals, clinics, or community health events. It is quick and cost-effective but may not fully represent the general population, as it focuses on individuals who actively seek healthcare.
        
· 
            Secondary Data Sources

· 
            Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Reports – The CDC provides national and state-level statistics on diabetes, including 
            incidence rates, demographic trends, and risk factors. This data helps researchers analyze long-term trends and develop prevention strategies.
        
· 
            Electronic Health Records (EHRs) – Medical records from hospitals and clinics provide valuable data on 
            patient history, blood sugar levels, medication use, and disease progression. This data helps track diabetes patterns and evaluate treatment effectiveness.
        

Case Identification and Definition

· 
            Primary data collection helps identify undiagnosed cases and provides 
            direct insights into risk factors, lifestyle choices, and disease management. It allows researchers to examine new cases and track individual health behaviors.
        
· 
            Secondary data offers a broader 
            understanding of population-wide trends, helping define case criteria and monitor disease progression over time. It is useful for comparing diabetes rates across different regions and demographic groups.

Emotion has been debated, analyzed, and researched across disciplines. Emotions are universal
phenomena for humans, and yet culture is very much at play in the emotional world. The norms of
culture and society affect how emotions are experienced. Consequently, different cultures express,
perceive, react to, and regulate emotion in very different ways.

Consider the emotion embarrassment. Across the globe, there are physiological responses associated
with embarrassment, such as elevated body temperature and blushing, that are common to all
humans (Shiraev & Levy, 2021). The verbal and non-verbal expression of embarrassment, however,
and even the precipitating events that can cause embarrassment, differ among cultures.

For this Assignment, you will consider emotional response to an event through a cross-cultural lens.
You will be asked to consider what your own emotional response, influenced by your cultural
background, would be, as well as consider a potential emotional response from someone from a
different cultural background.

Policy Analysis #2 (250 points)
            


PH 528 Final Exam


Graduate Students Only



Introduction: State Representative Joey Hood (Mississippi District 35) is the chairman of the Mississippi State House of Representatives Medicaid Committee. In 2022, the House let a measure die without a vote that would have allowed pregnant women who already qualify for Medicaid to get healthcare for an additional 10 months after childbirth. This bill is again up for debate in 2025.
        

There is little debate to be had about the merits of expanding Medicaid in Mississippi. However, there are competing viewpoints as to whether the best option is to 
            fully expand Medicaid as allowed under the Affordable Care Act or to 
            expand particular benefits for unique populations (like the postpartum bill). Representative Hood has asked you to write a policy analysis on this issue.
        



Sections: Must be 5 pages minimum- section page amounts are suggestions
            

1. 
            Problem Identification (1 sentence)

a. 
            How should Medicaid be expanded in the state of Mississippi?


2. 
            Background (~1 page)

a. Informs the reader why this particular problem has been chosen for analysis

3. 
            Landscape (~3 pages)

a. Provides the overall context for the analysis, organized by key factors

4. 
            Options (~1.5 pages)

a. State the two options (fully expand Medicaid or only expand particular benefits for unique populations) and give the positive and negative aspects of each

5. 
            Recommendation (~0.5 pages)

a. Choose one of your options as your recommendation and state why it is favored over the other option



Policy Analysis Format:
            

· No title, heading, or title page needed- just begin with your problem question
· Bolded section titles
· 5 pages of content (minimum, can be more) + reference page(s)
· Double-spaced, one-inch margins, 12 pt. Times New Roman font
· Can include tables if that helps to organize your thoughts



Other Notes:
            

· Read and use Ch. 14 in your textbook, which outlines how to write a policy analysis
· 
            All information should include an in-text citation and a mention on your reference page, cited in APA style
        
· Can reference scholarly articles, news articles, and reputable government, health, or non-profit agencies
· Avoid direct quotations from references- paraphrase and cite
· 
            
Your policy analysis will be run through SafeAssign to check for plagiarism- a SafeAssign score of more than 20% will receive an automatic zero




Due Date: Submit through Blackboard as a .doc or .docx file by 
            11:59 PM on Friday 3/7.

Descriptive Statistics and Data illustration:  In this section, the submission must summarize how the data was obtained (see chapter 1 of the text). Graphs and charts illustrating the main features of the data are also required - please see chapter 2 of the textbook.   Finally, a table of descriptive statistics accompanied by  description and explanations of the main features of the data are also required.
Statistical Method:  This part of the submission must explain the main statistical method(s) used in the case.   What is the theory behind it? What are the working hypotheses (null and alternative, etc.), what main measures, statistics, or parameters etc.,  are to be estimated or calculated using the method; how does it measures or calculates these measures, statistics, or parameters?  Finally, this section must describe how the results of the statistical method are interpreted. That is, what is it about the results that would indicate that the working hypotheses or research questions are confirmed or rejected or perhaps need to be modified and tested again? 
Results:  The actual results of the statistical method applied to the data are now presented in this section.  The section requires the student to describe the results and their theoretical interpretation based on the description of the method described in the previous section.
Conclusion and Recommendation:  This section restates the statistical results and applies it to the business situation in the case.  It also makes practical recommendations about what steps the business in the case can take going forward based on the results of the statistical analysis.  The application and recommendation can take one or more of these general forms.
    
The statistical results of the data analysis provided an answer(s) to the issues that the business is facing.  As a result specific policies or practical steps can be implemented in the business. 
 The statistical results of the data analysis provided only partial answers.  More research and tests need to be done to come up with a more useful answers for the business situation.
The statistical results did not provide any useful information for the challenges that a business(s) is facing.  Recommendations for conducting new research with new approaches, data, variables, etc. may be required. 
Note:  there is always room for 'further research' since it is impossible for a single research case to answer every possible question. 



 

The textbook provides narratives, questions, or actual steps/questions for each case study.  While these are useful for conducting actual research, the submission must take the form of a research report and follow the above pattern.
Consistent with the emphasis of this course on interpretation, an edited version of the answer key for the case study has been provided here.  Students are required to use the information to enhance their understanding of the statistical methods and the results obtained.

Nursing has undergone significant evolution over the years, transitioning from a role primarily focused on caregiving to an advanced, evidence-based profession integral to healthcare. This transformation has been evident across all areas of nursing, from acute care to community health. However, I would like to focus more specifically on the field of mental health nursing, which is the area in which I practice. The evolution of psychiatric-mental health nursing has been marked by significant changes over time, reflecting advancements in research, treatment modalities, and the recognition of mental health as a critical component of overall well-being. Despite these developments, historical challenges such as societal perceptions, stigma surrounding mental illness, lack of formal education, and limited recognition as a scientific discipline have shaped the field’s progression.
One of the earliest challenges in psychiatric nursing was the pervasive stigma surrounding mental illness. Historically, individuals with psychiatric conditions were often institutionalized with minimal medical care, and nursing interventions were largely custodial rather than therapeutic (McCurry et al., 2019). The absence of standardized psychiatric nursing education contributed to this issue, as mental health nurses were often seen as attendants rather than skilled professionals. Over time, the integration of psychiatric nursing into formal curricula and the emergence of therapeutic approaches, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and psychopharmacology, have strengthened the profession.
Another significant challenge was the exclusion of psychiatric nurses from higher education and scientific research. In the early 20th century, psychiatric nursing lacked specialized training programs, limiting its development as a distinct discipline. As a result, the profession was slow to adopt evidence-based practices, which are now foundational to modern psychiatric nursing (Porter-O'Grady et al., 2020). The establishment of psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner (PMHNP) programs has played a crucial role in advancing mental health nursing by integrating research, clinical expertise, and leadership.
Stigma and gender biases have also shaped the evolution of psychiatric nursing. Historically, psychiatric care was male-dominated, with physicians leading treatment efforts and nurses relegated to supportive roles. This dynamic limited the ability of nurses to contribute meaningfully to psychiatric interventions and policy development (D'Antonio, 2020). Today, PMHNPs play an essential role in diagnosing and treating mental illnesses, advocating for mental health policies, and leading community-based interventions. The expansion of the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degree has further strengthened the role of psychiatric nurses in healthcare leadership.
Despite these challenges, psychiatric nursing has evolved into a highly respected, research-driven field with a critical role in mental health care. The establishment of the DNP with a focus on psychiatric-mental health exemplifies the profession's commitment to integrating science and clinical expertise. The DNP emphasizes evidence-based practice, healthcare policy, leadership, and quality improvement, further advancing psychiatric nursing (AACN, 2021). By continuing to address historical barriers and embracing innovation, psychiatric-mental health nursing will remain at the forefront of mental healthcare transformation.

Assessment 4


Informatics and Nursing-Sensitive Quality Indicators


Prepare an 8–10 minute audio training tutorial (video is optional) for new nurses on the importance of nursing-sensitive quality indicators.
Collapse All

Introduction

The focus of Assessment 4 is on how informatics support monitoring of nursing-sensitive quality indicator data. You will develop an 8–10 minute audio (or video) training module to orient new nurses in a workplace to a single nursing-sensitive quality indicator critical to the organization. Your recording will address how data are collected and disseminated across the organization along with the nurses’ role in supporting accurate reporting and high quality results.

Professional Context

The American Nursing Association (ANA) established the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI®) in 1998 to track and report on quality indicators heavily influenced by nursing action.
NDNQI® was established as a standardized approach to evaluating nursing performance in relation to patient outcomes. It provides a database and quality measurement program to track clinical performance and to compare nursing quality measures against other hospital data at the national, regional, and state levels. Nursing-sensitive quality indicators help establish evidence-based practice guidelines in the inpatient and outpatient settings to enhance quality care outcomes and initiate quality improvement educational programs, outreach, and protocol development.
The quality indicators the NDNQI® monitors are organized into three categories: structure, process, and outcome. Theorist Avedis Donabedian first identified these categories. Donabedian’s theory of quality health care focused on the links between quality outcomes and the structures and processes of care (Grove et al., 2018).
Nurses must be knowledgeable about the indicators their workplaces monitor. Some nurses deliver direct patient care that leads to a monitored outcome. Other nurses may be involved in data collection and analysis. In addition, monitoring organizations, including managed care entities, exist to gather data from individual organizations to analyze overall industry quality. All of these roles are important to advance quality and safety outcomes.

Preparation

As you begin to prepare this assessment you are encouraged to complete the Donabedian Quality Assessment Framework activity. Quality health care delivery requires systematic action. Completion of this will help you succeed with the assessment as you consider how the triad of structure (such as the hospital, clinic, provider qualifications/organizational characteristics) and process (such as the delivery/coordination/education/protocols/practice style or standard of care) may be modified to achieve quality outcomes.
This assessment requires you to prepare an 8–10 minute narrated tutorial (with optional video) for new nurses on the importance of nursing-sensitive quality indicators. To successfully prepare for your assessment, you will need to complete the following preparatory activities:
· Review the nursing-sensitive quality indicators presented in the 
            

Assessment 04 -: Informatics and Nursing Sensitive Quality Indicators [PDF]



 Download Assessment 04 -: Informatics and Nursing Sensitive Quality Indicators [PDF]
            resource and select one nursing-sensitive quality indicator to use as the focus for this assessment.
        
· Conduct independent research on the most current information about the selected nursing-sensitive quality indicator.
· Interview a professional colleague or contact who is familiar with quality monitoring and how technology can help to collect and report quality indicator data. You do not need to submit the transcript of your conversation, but do integrate what you learned from the interview into the audio tutorial. Consider these questions for your interview:
· What is your experience with collecting data and entering it into a database?
· What challenges have you experienced?
· How does your organization share with the nursing staff and other members of the health care system the quality improvement monitoring results?
· What role do bedside nurses and other frontline staff have in entering the data? For example, do staff members enter the information into an electronic medical record for extraction? Or do they enter it into another system? How effective is this process?

Recording Your Presentation

To prepare to record your presentation, complete the following:
· Set up and test your microphone or headset and webcam using the installation instructions provided by the manufacturer. You only need to use the headset if your audio is not clear and high quality when captured by the microphone.
· Practice using the equipment to ensure the audio and video quality is sufficient.
· Review

 to request accommodations.
        

Instructions

For this assessment, first review the nursing-sensitive quality indicators presented in the 
            

Assessment 04 - Informatics and Nursing Sensitive Quality Indicators [PDF]



 Download Assessment 04 - Informatics and Nursing Sensitive Quality Indicators [PDF]
            resource and select one nursing-sensitive quality indicator to use as the focus for this assessment.
        
Next, imagine you are a member of a Quality Improvement Council at any type of health care system, whether acute, ambulatory, home health, managed care, et cetera. Your Council has identified that newly hired nurses would benefit from comprehensive training on the importance of nursing-sensitive quality indicators. The Council would like the training to address how this information is collected and disseminated across the organization. It would also like the training to describe the role nurses have in accurate reporting and high-quality results.
The council prefers a recorded presentation using PowerPoint or a similar application. This will allow the education department to show the presentation during new hire training.
As a result of this need, you offer to create a presentation orienting new hires to these topics. You know that you will need speakers notes to guide your recording. You plan to incorporate the insights you learned from conducting an interview with an authority on quality monitoring and the use of technology to collect and report quality indicator data.
You determine that you will cover the following topics in your presentation:

Introduction: Nursing-Sensitive Quality Indicator

· What is the National Database of Nursing-Sensitive Quality Indicators?
· What are nursing-sensitive quality indicators?
· Which particular quality indicator did you select to address in your tutorial?
· Why is this quality indicator important to monitor?
· Be sure to address the impact of this indicator on the quality of care and patient safety.
· Why do new nurses need to be familiar with this particular quality indicator when providing patient care?

Collection and Distribution of Quality Indicator Data

· According to your interview and other resources, how does your organization collect data on this quality indicator?
· How does the organization disseminate aggregate data?
· What role do nurses play in supporting accurate reporting and high-quality results?
· As an example, consider the importance of accurately entering data regarding nursing interventions.

Enhancing Outcomes

· Explain how your health care organization uses nursing-sensitive quality indicators to enhance patient safety, patient care outcomes, and organizational performance reports.
· Describe how a nursing-sensitive quality indicator establishes evidence-based practice guidelines for nurses to follow when using patient care technologies to enhance patient safety, satisfaction, and outcomes.
After building your presentation in PowerPoint, Keynote, Slides, Canva, or another presentation platform, practice delivering your tutorial several times before recording. When you record your presentation be sure your slides are visible in the recording. 
            Important: Record your narrated presentation in Kaltura. (Do not record and submit the narration in PowerPoint because your file will become too large to upload.)
        

Additional Requirements

· 
            Communication: Deliver a professional, effective tutorial on a selected quality indicator that engages new nurses and motivates them to accurately report quality data in a timely fashion.
        
· 
            Length: 8–10 minute recording. Use Kaltura to record the narration and upload your recording to the courseroom or provide a working link your instructor can access.
        
· 
            Script: A separate document with the script or speaker's notes is required. 
            Important: Submissions that do not include the script or speaker's notes will be returned as a non-performance.
        
· 
            References: Cite a minimum of three scholarly and/or authoritative sources.
        
· 
            APA: Submit, along with the recording, a separate reference page that follows APA style and formatting guidelines. For an APA refresher, consult the

Discussion : Hypernasal speech can result from an... | Psychology,"Hypernasal speech can result from an abnormal communication or passageway between the oral and nasal cavities, allowing air to move through them and out the nose unintentionally when the speaker tries to pronounce sounds such as m. A test for such air passage is to place a feather at the nostril while making the m sound; if it moves, there is air leakage, and the sound the speaker makes is not the sound that her or she intends. How does this happen? One way is through clefts of the palate. Closely aligned with cleft palates, though not necessarily cooccurring with them, are cleft lips. These can affect articulation and the sounds that require the lips to be sealed tightly.
The purpose of this discussion is for you to apply your understanding of articulation and resonation to cleft lip/palate. This discussion is intended to allow you to show evidence that you have achieved the following Learning Outcomes:
CLO2: Analyze physiology of communication (ILO3, PLO3)

Diversity Dynamics – Questions



Part I:

Select three (3) people of any age who can draw (this can be done individually or in groups, but they must not copy from one another, and each person must draw separately without looking at others’ work. They can be from the same family or different ones).
Provide each participant with a sheet of paper and a pencil, pen, crayons, etc. Instruct them to individually create a drawing of what they consider to be a ""typical family."" It is important that participants refrain from asking questions such as, “Can we draw as many people as we want?” or “Can we include pets?” The instruction is simply: 
            Draw what, in your opinion, represents a typical family. (These questions should not be answered, as doing so might influence their drawings).
        
Clarify that the drawing does not need to be highly detailed and should take approximately 10 minutes to complete. Additionally, participants should include a brief description of the family members in their drawing, such as their age, occupation, whether or not they work, and any hobbies. They may provide as much descriptive detail as they wish.
Once the drawings are complete, ask the participants to explain their work and record their answers:
· The age of each family member
· Whether they work and their profession
· Hobbies
· Other details
Ask:
· Does your family reflect the characteristics depicted in the drawing?
· Why or why not? Please elaborate.
· If the answer is 
            no, why did you draw that type of family?
        
(Note: Participants often depict a father who works and has a professional occupation, while mothers may or may not work. Typically, there are two children: an older boy and a younger girl. Observations often include disparities in age and height, with the father being the tallest and oldest figure. Additionally, mothers are frequently portrayed without a professional degree or in professions associated with lower economic compensation compared to the father’s profession. Gender roles also emerge, with daughters often depicted engaging in activities like “ballet,” while sons participate in “soccer.”)
 

Part II: Reflection Questions

Once the typical family has been drawn and the questions answered, conduct the following analysis:
· What type of family was most commonly drawn, and why do you think this was the case?
· How many families with these characteristics do you know? What makes you think these families have these characteristics?
· Why do we believe families are like this (as depicted in the drawing)?
· Do we hold other stereotypes? What are they?
· Reflect on the experience.


Assignment: Essay

Develop a written piece with your opinion.
It must include at least three (3) paragraphs with no fewer than 350 words in size 12 font, addressing the following:
· In what order of priority would you place the three (3) forms of family disintegration discussed in this module? Justify your response.
· Which one do you think occurs most frequently, and why?

CO5: Examine the rudiments of the Structured Query Language (SQL).
Instructions
Note the techniques below associated with the rudiments of Structured Query Language (SQL), explain how you would apply at least three of the techniques to a medical records database.

The Structured Query Language (SQL) is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It's essential for working with databases to store, retrieve, and manipulate data. Here are some of the rudiments of SQL:

SELECT Statement: The most common SQL statement, used to retrieve data from a database.
sqlCopy codeSELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
INSERT Statement: Used to add new records into a table.
sqlCopy codeINSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);
UPDATE Statement: Used to modify existing records in a table.
sqlCopy codeUPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
DELETE Statement: Used to remove records from a table.
sqlCopy codeDELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
CREATE TABLE Statement: Used to define a new table and its columns.
sqlCopy codeCREATE TABLE table_name ( column1 datatype, column2 datatype, ... );
ALTER TABLE Statement: Used to modify an existing table structure.
sqlCopy codeALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name datatype;
DROP TABLE Statement: Used to delete an existing table.
sqlCopy codeDROP TABLE table_name;
SELECT DISTINCT: Used to retrieve unique values from a column.
sqlCopy codeSELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;
ORDER BY Clause: Used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order.
sqlCopy codeSELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name ORDER BY column1 ASC, column2 DESC;
WHERE Clause: Used to filter records based on specified conditions.
sqlCopy codeSELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
JOIN Clause: Used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
sqlCopy codeSELECT column1, column2 FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
GROUP BY Clause: Used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns.
sqlCopy codeSELECT column1, COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1;
HAVING Clause: Used with GROUP BY to filter the result set based on aggregated values.
sqlCopy codeSELECT column1, COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1 HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;

These are just some of the fundamental SQL concepts and statements. SQL is a powerful language that allows you to perform complex data manipulation and retrieval operations on databases.

2A. 


Voluntary Post-Exit Interview


   Good Morning. Today, I am interviewing a close friend and soon-to-be co-worker again. For her privacy, we are going to call her Sarah. Sarah and I worked together at the largest high school in Hillsborough County, where she was the student affairs secretary.  

High School Student Affairs Secretary

According to the Secretary 1 position job description dated August 1, 2018, from Hillsborough County Public School (HCPS) website, Secretary 1 is responsible for general correspondence, answering phones, filing, typing, greeting parents and students, and performing other clerical duties as needed.        
The Secretary of Student Affairs actually conducts sign-ins and sign-outs, updates all substitute attendance rosters, hang tags, lockers, call logs, excused notes, testing slips, lock-out drills, student drop-off items, dress code violations, administrative disciplinary action correspondence, distributes all administrative and teacher mail, and handles all other student-related matters for the administrative staff and principal. 

Interview

As our Module 8 reading stated, voluntary turnover can be avoidable or unavoidable. In Sarah's case, it is interesting to see if her supervisors could have influenced her reason for leaving or if it was out of their control. I will let you decide.
The interview questions were:
1. 
            What brought you to us, and how long have you worked here?

I moved here from Buffalo, New York when the COVID-19 pandemic occurred. My husband and I retired here, and I wanted a job with summers and holidays off, so I interviewed for the job and have been here for 3 years.  
2. 
            Explain what caused you to leave?

When I first came to the school, we had both middle school and high school students, so we allocated additional administrative principals (APs), success coaches, counselors, and staff to assist with around 3,000 students. The three-year phase-out of the middle school ended in 2022, with an enrollment of around 3,400 students. Last year was the first year with only high schoolers, and we have grown to 3,800 students with less staff support. The increased student volume, fewer administrative personnel, and weak county, school district, and internal policies are causing me to leave. The boiling point for me was when a 14-year-old boy was arrested for having a firearm on campus, and only a month later, another boy was arrested for having a firearm (Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, 2025). This is coupled with multiple fights and no longer feeling safe at my place of work.
3. 
            What measures could have helped to prevent you from leaving?

I by no means blame the good staff and teachers I work with; they have to work with the people they are given on top of all the current vacancies (many teachers left after COVID-19 to other careers). Florida currently has a Fortify FL system that allows any staff member or student to report suspicious activity on an app. All staff also have Centegix badges that can activate a signal from anywhere on campus if we see a threat. These are reactive measures, not proactive measures.
I believe stronger laws and policies to support the school in taking preventive approaches, such as the Safe Schools Against Violence in Education (SAVE) Act, would help. The SAVE Act promotes safe learning environments where students and teachers work collaboratively with codes of conduct, school safety plans, and school violence prevention and intervention (New York State Education Department, 2025). 
Another effective tool is ensuring there is an updated employee handbook. Having written standards and policies lets employees know what is tolerated and what is not to minimize lousy behavior (Kaus, 2008). 
4. 
            Were you provided with any negotiations before departing?

In my current place of employment, I was not. However, I interviewed and was selected to work at a different high school with a smaller student population and a more secure campus layout.  
An astounding 42% of employees who voluntarily left their organization in the past year reported that their supervisor or organization could have done something to prevent them from leaving the job (Tatel & Wigert, 2024, para 4).

Summary

Exit interviews are a great way to understand and try to resolve turnover rates. Turnover becomes a serious problem when a talent gap impacts the organization's ability to execute its business strategy and operate effectively (Kochanski & Sorensen, 2008). 
As described in our Module 8 reading, every human resource (HR) function should have retention as its primary goal. In Sarah's case, she left for intrinsic rewards (a safe working environment), not extrinsic rewards such as pay or bonuses. The hard part is that intrinsic rewards require more effort from supervisors and leadership and are sometimes impossible if you do not have enough supervisors to conduct day-to-day operations, as in this case.

1B.

An interview was conducted with a manager of marketing, communications, and community development at a local Medicaid managed care organization. This individual has been with the organization for seven years, and their current role encompasses managing the various communications that are developed and distributed throughout the community. They are also responsible for developing and implementing the marketing plan, ensuring budget adherence, and collaborating with other departments to drive quality improvement and population health initiatives.
In conducting the stay interview, the interviewee emphasized that one of the main reasons for staying on this job is the benefits that the organization offers. The organization offers health benefits, including insurance plans that are cheaper than many of the alternatives. For example, the interviewee stated that they actually turned down a job that came with a higher salary because the health benefits were substantially less than what she was currently receiving, and she would have essentially been paying hundreds of extra dollars per month. Along with that, the employee also stated that they have remained with the company because the organization is highly flexible, as the employee works remotely and can easily organize her schedule in a way that accommodates her family life, such as blocking off her calendar in the afternoon so she can pick her child up from the bus stop. She also stated that she enjoys her coworkers and values the culture of the organization as a whole. When asked about reasons the employee may consider leaving, she indicated that she may leave if offered a better opportunity with a comparable salary with similar health benefits, so long as that opportunity came with significant potential for advancement.
At this organization, it is clear that employee retainment is prioritized, especially through a strong organizational culture inside of values that keep employees feeling acknowledged, appreciated, and respected. When employees feel valued, they are more likely to remain with an organization (Rogers & Ashforth, 2017). The employee also indicated that she enjoyed the flexibility of her job, which is especially important for working parents, as per Eek and Axmon (2013). Finally, this interview helped emphasize the fact that salary alone is often not enough to retain employees. A total rewards package that includes a variety of benefits, such as good health coverage, paid time off, professional development opportunities, and similar are all necessary to keep employees feeling valued and motivated (Cafaro, 2021).

Competency
In this project, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following competencies:
· Craft a communication strategy for internal and external audiences
· Leverage internal and external intelligence to inform decision making
· Develop an adaptable leadership mindset and skill set
Scenario
You work as a director of leadership and learning for an organization that makes prosthetics. The organization has been in business since 1999 and employs over 350 people in its Tampa, Florida, headquarters and three plant locations across the Southwest. While the business is currently based in the United States, the organization is exploring ways to move into Canadian markets within the next three years. This year’s employee engagement survey results for the organization show that some leadership practices are rated lower, while some practices were rated higher. The new chief human resources officer (CHRO) met with the team to discuss the general results. Everyone agrees that the company’s focus should be on both specific leadership development areas perceived as strengths and on those rated as areas for improvement, primarily regarding social intelligence, emotional intelligence, and the interpersonal skills of effective leaders.
To help this initiative, your manager, the vice president of leadership and learning, asked you to create an adaptive leadership toolkit that can be used throughout the organization. To begin this work, you conducted a personal leadership self-assessment and turned this into a personal development plan. Then you shared this artifact with your manager. Your manager was impressed with the thoroughness of the personal development plan and saw value in incorporating it as an exemplar within the adaptive leadership toolkit for use by all people leaders in the organization. After receiving such positive feedback, you moved forward with creating the rest of the adaptive leadership toolkit.
Your manager has shared the adaptive leadership toolkit that you created with the CHRO, and it was well received. The CHRO wants to distribute this toolkit to all leaders throughout the organization—supervisors and above—and asks you to create a communication strategy that will help in the rollout and implementation of the adaptive leadership toolkit. For this project, you will create that communication strategy.

In Module Nine, you will post your initial response, and then in Module Ten, you will respond to two other learners' posts. This allows you additional time to make your initial post strong, robust, and well supported.
Today's world of business is significantly impacted by technological advances. This blurring of boundaries between the physical, digital, and biological world is referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR). Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, the internet of things (IoT), 3D printing, genetic engineering, quantum computing, and other technologies impact the way work gets done, how products are produced, and how companies achieve their objectives. Regardless of the company's size, age, or industry, advances in technology such as artificial intelligence are making their way into the daily practices of companies, and companies must consider the implications of the Fourth IR when developing strategic plans.
Consider the role these advances can play in your selected company's strategic planning.
In Module Nine, compose your initial post by addressing the following:
· Provide a brief overview of the company you have chosen for your project; where is it headquartered, and what are the services or products it provides?
· Pick an aspect of the Fourth IR (advances in artificial intelligence, robotics, the internet of things, 3D printing, genetic engineering, quantum computing, or another technology).
· How could this impact a company's strategic planning?
· Specifically, how could this aspect play a role in the strategic planning for your company?
· Within your company, what are two dangers of this aspect of the Fourth IR?

ORG
Competencies
In this project, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following competencies:
· Analyze internal and external business environments
· Recommend short-term and long-term strategic focuses
· Communicate strategy to a variety of audiences
Scenario
You have been appointed the director of strategic planning for the Fortune Global 500 company you selected in Module One.
The vice president of strategy and operations (VP) has confided in you that strategic planning has been a challenge for the company over the past year; specifically, crafting new strategies and aligning them to the company’s mission and goals. You have now been tasked with creating a new strategic planning proposal to help the company explore at least one new growth opportunity to increase its revenue or market share in the industry.
Your proposal should present a detailed analysis of the company’s internal and external environments as well as specific actions the company can take over the next five years to achieve the targeted growth. Your proposal will be presented to various stakeholders at different levels in the organization, so you will need to adapt parts of your proposal to suit different needs. Additionally, you will need to send a shorter executive summary of your proposal to the leadership team.

Summary Paragraph 

In the book, “Immigration: The Reference Shelf,” Reid Long discusses why many people from Mexico 

come to the United States. According to Long (1996), “Their illegal flight northward in search of a better 

lifestyle is predictable, and the Mexican government does not work very hard to prevent it” (p.49). This means 

that the Mexican government does not care of the illegal crossing of Mexico’s people into the United States 

when they are in search of a better lifestyle. Immigrants from Mexico come to the United States in search of a 

job, or in some cases more than one, to make money. They come in search of something better knowing it does 

not come easy, knowing there is a risk along with it. Parts of Mexico live in poverty and no effort on behalf of 

the government is done to fix it because they are known to be corrupt. Poverty is what pushes these people to 

make that long dangerous journey to the northside, knowing it will be better in the long run or if they get 

caught, they try again. This can lead to another topic related to immigration, criminalization.

C) RESEARCH PAPER PROSPECTUS (DUE 9 MARCH ) (10% of course grade): 
All students must submit a minimum four-page prospectus of their intended research paper project 
for approval by the instructor no later than 9 March. I give students as much latitude as possible to 
pursue topics that they are genuinely interested in: it results in better papers! So, you can propose 
any historiographic study of military or diplomatic history (perhaps one connected with a desired 
capstone research agenda?). You can also choose one of the historiographical issues and debates 
covered in seminar. You can also write a paper on a specific aspect of diplomatic theory and/or 
practice or a paper on military theorists and their impact on military history. Nonetheless, it is the 
prospectus writer’s responsibility to demonstrate the appropriateness of their proposed research 
paper to the course, its contents, and themes. The purpose of the prospectus is to assist you in 
generating a realistic and feasible research agenda that you can complete and get a good grade 
for! So, it is for your benefit. For me, it allows me to understand where you want to go, to assist you 
in refining your topic into one that is feasible and meaningful, and thereby getting you off to the best 
start on your topic and as early as possible!  
 
Over the first part of the semester, you should develop and refine research agenda in consultation 
with the instructor. At the center of all historical enquiry, is identifying a central research agenda 
that you want to examine and the historiography associated with it. Once you have identified the 
focus of your research agenda, you need to develop a short list of the most relevant titles that have 
shaped the historiography of this research agenda. This you can do by checking bibliographic 
references from the books in the class, via online literature searches, reviewing reference sources, 
browsing in libraries, looking for historiographical review essays in journals, and consulting with the 
instructor for suggestions and guidance. You will develop a short list of titles you intend to examine 
in your historiographical review. You can ‘lump’ multiple sources into a single historiographical 
school and treat that school collectively (i.e., you could examine one representative example). You 
goal is to accurately identify the major interpretative trends over time relating to your research 
agenda and seek to suggest reasons for those interpretive changes. You can develop a basic grasp 
of the literature by examining book reviews online or from journals, examining review articles 
(articles written by experts reviewing the literature), and by obtaining and reading the most 
influential interpretive secondary source books and articles themselves. If you are going to focus 
on an aspect of diplomatic theory or practice (or a specific diplomatic crisis), you will likewise want 
to identify the most important works written on or related to the focus of your research.  
 
Your prospectus should be a synopsis of your planned paper. It should explain what the focus of 
your historical/historiographical research paper is. You should also outline the literature you have 
identified to date and plan to use and discuss you preliminary understanding of what divergent 
interpretations the secondary sources you have identified offer. You should include a brief 
annotated bibliography of the  major secondary sources you have identified/plan to analyze and 
briefly assessing (in a couple of sentences) their perspective/contribution to the historiography on 
your research agenda.

Direction of Nursing Practice in the 21st Century’

As an advanced practice nurse (APN), integrating middle-range or situation-specific 
theories into practice becomes paramount for enhanced patient outcomes. The 
theories serve as a template for understanding clinical scenarios and guiding 
interventions for individual patients. A perfect example of such a theory for use in 
primary healthcare practice is ‘Orem's Self-Care Deficit Nursing Theory (SCDNT)’ (Yip, 
2021). The theory focuses on assessing patients' capacity for self-care and 
implementing the necessary interventions. With such theories, APNs can streamline 
their decision-making and promote patient-centered practice. Utilizing nursing theories 
in AP practice also ensures a systematic approach toward practice, and treatment 
plans and assessments can be performed with some degree of standardization.


Bridging the gap between practice and theory must be multidimensional. Incorporating 
evidence-based practice (EBP) into practice ensures nursing interventions are research 
and proven methods (Almutlak et al., 2023). In addition to experience, mentors and 
clinical preceptorship facilitate translating classroom knowledge into practice. 
Fostering a culture of professional and continuing learning keeps nurses updated with 
new theories and their effective utilization in practice. Besides, incorporating 
informatics and computer utilization in nursing practice strengthens data collection, 
which nursing theories can feed into and substantiate.


Studying nursing philosophy has expanded my understanding of the discipline's 
foundational concepts, such as the importance of empiric knowledge confirmation in 
practice. I have also widened my understanding of nursing theory and its contribution 
to patient care, research, and policy. I had been interested in understanding theoretical 




practice, and I did it by researching various nursing models and integrating them into 
practice. I also learned about the significance of theory improvement and adaptation 
to changing healthcare needs. The knowledge has confirmed the significance of 
evidence-based nursing and ongoing professional development, and I can continue 
being a competent and knowledgeable practitioner.

Discussion Post Reply #2

Before advanced practice nurses can integrate mid-range or situation-specific theories into 
practice, they must first be familiar with the theories. This class has been a great introduction 
to theories. A spreadsheet or poster would be good to list many of them and a summary of 
each theory. Addressing specific patient needs will help to identify what theory would be most 
useful, for example, incorporating Kolcaba’s Comfort Theory for a patient needing palliative 
care. I am partial to Jean Watson so I feel every patient would benefit from the Theory of 
Human Caring or Swanson’s Theory of Caring to build trusting nurse-patient relationships.  


Three ways to bridge the theory-practice gap: 


1. We are actively participating in one of the ways to bridge the gap by attending a Nurse 
Theory class.  


2. In a clinical setting, having a poster or having easy access to different theories and 
theorists would be beneficial to be able to apply appropriate theories per patient's 
needs.  


3. Organizational support would help with consistency in using theories to improve patient 
care.  


A repertoire is a skill set or knowledge and in the context of philosophy I have gained in-depth 
knowledge of one theorist, and familiarity with many theories. My comfort level is high for 
applying the Theory of Human Caring in practice. My comfort level is higher than it was for 
applying any other theory.  


Leaning about theory can improve patient care and outcomes. For every patient situation, a 
theory can be applied that will assist with care delivery, critical thinking, decision making, 
involvement of patients in the treatment plan, strengthening the nurse-patient relationships, 
improving communication, and providing better outcomes for patients (Gains, 2024).  


In the opening discussion, my goals were to gain a foundation on what nursing theory is, to be 
able to recognize nursing theorists, and to stay on top of assignments so as to not get 
overwhelmed with the number of assignments due for this class. I am happy to report that I 
achieved all my goals. My previous knowledge of nursing theory consisted only of Florence 
Nightingale’s Environmental Theory and the importance of hand washing and a clean 
environment. Nightingale’s Notes on Nursing sets the premise on basing nursing practice on 
observation of the sick and their environment (Chinn & Kramer, 2011).  Now I know that nursing 
theories guide nursing practice and influence nurse-patient relationships and interactions. I 
have a comfortable base of theoretical knowledge and enhanced skills on theory research to 
find what might be best applicable in each situation. The third goal of staying on top of 
assignments was attained as evidenced by not being late on any assignments and usually 
finishing them with time to spare and focus on other classes. I was initially overwhelmed with 
having to read a whole book on top of other assignments, but I enjoyed the book and the 




psychology related to it. The excessive case load made this my least favorite class at times. 
Sometimes I hated this class. But what I learned will be beneficial and applicable to my 
practice as a nurse practitioner, so in the end it was worth it.",Nursing,Apa|Nursing,https://www.sweetstudy.com/questions/8apost-replies

In Chapter 11, Kriesberg examines the challenges of conflict resolution. Share your 
interpretation of the challenges outlined by the author and provide insights on the most

Reply from Miruslaba Quezada 

Some of the challenges that Kriesberg analyses are the following:  

Structural Power imbalances 

The interpretation of this is that in conflicts there are uneven playing fields, this means that 
some of the parties that are involved in conflict don't have the power in order to negotiate or 
defend themselves the way that higher parties or more powerful parties have the ability to.  

One way of solving this is being able to provide legal and equal protections for everyone,

negotiation levels.  

Deep rooted Emotions 

This types of conflicts happen when the conflict or the problem are tied to ethnicity, or religion, 
culture etc. These conflicts are hard to resolve because they can be tied to deep values and 
beliefs that can make problems a lot harder to resolve.  

Resolving these we can make sure that injustices are acknowledged and a place where past 
conflicts in cultures can be shared and heard can create a place of trust and recognition. This 
can create a reduction of fear and shape trust.  

Mistrust  

Mistrust can make conflicts hard to resolve because this creates a history of betrayal which 
could make it hard to believe the sincerity of the other party when it comes to the conflict.  

I think for this one it would be hard in order to find a resolution because trust takes a lot of time 
to build but one way that this can be done would be to start with smaller portions of the conflict, 
and creating agreements or even a trade for certain conflicts. Another one would be involving a 
mediator, this can create a person that is non biased and can help both sides make the 
negotiation process a lot easier.  

Fear Of the Future Conflict 


https://canvas.pdx.edu/courses/94652/users/56976




This creates many barriers in conflict resolution, this is because this fear can make past conflicts 
to resurface, and even if peace is ever reached one side can fear that the conflict wont stay 
resolved and more problems may come in the future  

Addressing this requires a way of trust building and just finding ways in order to keep that trust 
going and make it stringer. This can be in ways of small agreements and even partnerships.  

Cultural Differences  

This can be hard in conflict because it can create misundertandings and tensions, these 
differeces can be something like differences in language, traditions and values. When there is 
not a good method to manage these it can escalate tensions and even become a source that 
escalates problems.  

Adressing this requires understanding of differences which can be in ways of teaching one 
another about each others cultural differences especially leaders and educators in order to 
make communication easier.  

Inadequate Frameworks for Resolution 

In many conflicts having a noneffective framework for resolution like ineffective negotiation 
processes can make things difficult because problems can escalate very quickly and even 
persist for longer period of time.  

In addressing this the strength of the existing frameworks should be addressed this can be in 
ways of avoiding biased institutions, and creating clear policies that can address the existing 
conflict.

In Chapter 11 of Kriesberg's Conflict Resolution, the author goes into the complex challenges 
that arise in conflict resolution processes. These challenges are multi-dimensional, stemming 
from both the inherent nature of conflicts and the difficulties associated with their resolution. 
Some of the key challenges Kriesberg outlines are: 


https://canvas.pdx.edu/courses/94652/users/113701




1. Structural and Power Imbalances 

● Interpretation: Conflict often arises from or is exacerbated by uneven power 
dynamics, whether in terms of wealth, authority, or access to resources. When one 
party holds more power, it can lead to an imbalance in negotiations or solutions, 
making it harder for less powerful groups to have their concerns addressed fairly. 

● Addressing the Challenge: The resolution process must seek to equalize power or 
create mechanisms that allow for more equitable negotiation. This can be achieved 
through the inclusion of mediators or third parties who help level the playing field, 
and by fostering transparency and trust between parties. 

2. Deep-rooted Emotions and Identities 

● Interpretation: Many conflicts, especially those of an ethnic, religious, or cultural 
nature, are tied to deeply rooted emotions and identities. These emotions can make 
it difficult for parties to engage in rational discussions, as issues like dignity, honor, 
and self-determination are involved. 

● Addressing the Challenge: To resolve such conflicts, it's crucial to engage in 
dialogues that validate each party’s feelings and identities. Creating safe spaces for 
open and respectful communication, and allowing individuals to share personal 
experiences, can help in acknowledging these emotional and identity-based 
components. 

3. Mistrust and Hostility 

● Interpretation: Mistrust between conflicting parties often exacerbates the situation, 
preventing meaningful dialogue and cooperative problem-solving. Hostility can arise 
from historical grievances, past betrayals, or ongoing injustices, and this deep 
distrust can derail any attempts at peaceful resolution. 

● Addressing the Challenge: Building trust is a gradual process that requires 
consistent efforts from both sides. Conflict resolution strategies must involve 
confidence-building measures, such as small, manageable agreements or steps that 
show the parties that compromise is possible. Third-party mediators can also help in 
ensuring fairness and impartiality, contributing to rebuilding trust. 

4. Uncertainty and Fear of the Future 

● Interpretation: When parties are uncertain about the future or fear that a resolution 
will not result in long-term peace or fairness, they may resist coming to the 
negotiating table or making concessions. This fear is often linked to concerns about 
the potential consequences of a resolution. 

● Addressing the Challenge: To mitigate fear and uncertainty, conflict resolution 
efforts should focus on creating clear, tangible outcomes and guarantees that 
address the core concerns of all parties. It's essential to ensure that the resolution 
includes provisions for monitoring, enforcement, and adaptation over time. 

5. Cultural and Societal Differences 




● Interpretation: Different cultural perspectives can make it difficult for parties to 
understand each other's values, communication styles, and needs. These cultural 
differences can act as barriers to empathy and compromise. 

● Addressing the Challenge: Promoting cross-cultural understanding and 
competence is essential. This can involve bringing in culturally sensitive mediators or 
facilitators who understand the nuances of the groups involved, as well as designing 
conflict resolution processes that respect cultural practices and beliefs. 

6. Escalation and Entrenchment 

● Interpretation: Conflicts often escalate over time, with both parties becoming more 
entrenched in their positions. As the conflict becomes more polarized, it becomes 
harder to move towards a resolution because both sides feel that they have too 
much invested in their stance. 

● Addressing the Challenge: To address this, conflict resolution efforts must work to 
de-escalate tensions and foster communication in a way that encourages flexibility 
and openness. The process should aim at breaking the cycle of escalation by 
focusing on shared interests and creating opportunities for compromise. 

7. Inadequate Frameworks for Resolution 

● Interpretation: Sometimes, conflicts persist because there is no suitable framework 
or structure for resolution. This could be due to the absence of effective institutions, 
legal structures, or mechanisms for dialogue. 

● Addressing the Challenge: Creating or strengthening institutional frameworks that 
support negotiation and conflict resolution is essential. This includes establishing 
legal systems, peace-building organizations, and conflict mediation structures that 
are neutral and capable of handling disputes effectively.

When you are finished reviewing the background materials, go through each of the scenarios below and apply what you’ve read to these scenarios. For each scenario, cite at least one of the required readings to support your answer. You should cite at least three of the four required readings in your paper. Your paper should be 4–5  pages in length:

A corporation notices that suddenly turnover in the human resource department has been extremely high. This corporations prides itself on having a dedicated and committed workforce, so this high turnover in one department is highly troubling for this company. Normally the human resource department investigates when there is a high turnover rate in a department. But since the human resource department is now the department with the high turnover rate, the CEO decides that an outside consultant should be hired to investigate the high turnover rate and propose solutions. Should this team use an Appreciative Inquiry consultant, or hire a more traditional Organizational Development consultant? Explain your reasoning with references to the required readings.
An organization hires an Appreciative Inquiry consultant to help the company get back on track and improve the performance of its product design team. The consultant starts by asking members of the team how they would like the team to perform and what their ideal vision of the team would be. The consultant collects all of this input and designs a detailed plan regarding how to achieve this ideal future that the team dreams about. However, once this detailed plan is presented to the team they are all shocked that the consultant came up with such an unrealistic plan. Team members say that the expenses involved in this plan are far beyond their budget, and they would also need to hire many new team members in order to achieve this plan in a realistic time frame. They all agree it would be great if they had the time and money to implement this plan, but they also are in consensus that this plan presented by the consultant is highly unrealistic. What do you think went wrong? What steps do you think the Appreciative Inquiry consultant could have taken to make the consulting process go better? Refer to the specific “5 Ds” of Appreciative Inquiry in your answer.
A group of ten friends decide to start a new social networking company and put their savings together to start this new business. The company grows rapidly for the first five years and morale is very high in the company during this time. Everyone gets along very well and they work together cooperatively in order to continuously improve the company and its services. However, after five years the company stops growing and seems to reach a plateau. Morale seems to drop and there is now noticeable tension between employees including the top leadership team. They are not sure what to do revive the company, so they decide to hire a consultant. Should this team use an Appreciative Inquiry approach or a more traditional organizational development approach? Explain your reasoning with references to the required readings.
A large supermarket chain decides they would like to expand to have an online division where consumers can order online and have their groceries delivered directly to their homes. The supermarket decides to create a special taskforce to come up with a detailed plan on how they should develop and manage the new online division. This taskforce includes a diverse variety of employees including those from the marketing department, accounting department, inventory department, and most of the main departments. These employees do not have much experience working with each other since they are from different departments. After meeting regularly for a few months, the taskforce makes almost no progress and are constantly bickering. Management is concerned that the online division will never get off the ground. To get back on track and find a way to function more smoothly, should this taskforce use an Appreciative Inquiry approach or a more traditional organizational development approach?

Rationale
Hypernasal speech can result from an abnormal communication or passageway between the oral and nasal cavities, allowing air to move through them and out the nose unintentionally when the speaker tries to pronounce sounds such as m. A test for such air passage is to place a feather at the nostril while making the m sound; if it moves, there is air leakage, and the sound the speaker makes is not the sound that her or she intends. How does this happen? One way is through clefts of the palate. Closely aligned with cleft palates, though not necessarily cooccurring with them, are cleft lips. These can affect articulation and the sounds that require the lips to be sealed tightly.
The purpose of this is for you to apply your understanding of articulation and resonation to cleft lip/palate. This Assignment is intended to allow you to show evidence that you have achieved the following Learning Outcomes:
CLO2: Analyze physiology of communication (ILO3, PLO3)
CLO3: Apply knowledge of anatomy and physiology of communication to diagnose and treat patients with communication disorders (ILO3, PLO3)
Directions

Describe the causes and treatment of a cleft lip and the effects of the condition of the production of speech sounds.

All book reviews must be done on a word processor, be double-spaced (using Times New Roman, 12 pt. font) and strictly adhere to length requirements - 5 to 7 pages in length (no more, no less). DO NOT put extra spaces between paragraphs.  There is to be a one-inch margin on all sides (meaning top, bottom, & both sides). Notes should be parenthetical or line notes, as the following example from Friedreich Nietzsche’s 
            The Genealogy of Morals illustrates:
        
Nietzsche believed that “the priestly system of valuations” too easily branched off from
the aristocratic and developed into its antithesis. (591) - notice that following the punctuation (period), there is a space, followed by the page number(s) in brackets. Be careful about overusing quotations - this is your review - only use a few carefully selected words, phrases, or sentences which best impart the essence of what the author is trying to say.  
Grammar, punctuation and spelling should be correct and follow standard usage. You are strongly urged to purchase and consult a “Style Guide;” the most widely used seems to be Kate L. Turabian’s 
            A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses and Dissertations. One should always have a good dictionary and thesaurus handy as well; most word processing programs have them built-in. Bibliographical information for your book should be located at the top of page one (just below your name) and be 
            single-spaced and include the book's full title (underlined), author's full name, place of publication, publisher, and year of publication (note: the bibliographic entry is the only part of the review where you should use single-spacing; the rest of your paper should be double-spaced).  An example of a standard bibliographic entry appears as follows:
        

The Presidency of George Washington, by Forest McDonald. Lawrence: University of Kansas Press, 
        
1974.  

Your review should progress in the manner outlined below:
        
1) 
            TOPIC - what is the book about? - get to this quickly and clearly.  In this section you may want to discuss the author’s background is that information is available to you.  What are his or her qualifications?
        


2) 
            THESIS (and 
            purpose and 
            method) - what is the author tying to prove (thesis) in writing this book (in other words, what is(are) the main point(s) the author is trying to get across to the reader); also, why is he or she writing this book (
            purpose); and how is he or she going to prove the thesis (
            method)?
        
Answers to the two questions above are often easily found in the Preface, Introduction, and the
Conclusion; however, sometimes authors do not organize their works properly, and or they are hiding their real intentions. In such cases one must dig a little deeper to find the author’s real intentions.

It is important that you 
            
fully analyze the author’s main contention (or contentions)
            .  Do not simply state what the thesis is; you must explain how the author has constructed his or her argument (or arguments).  How has the author arrived at his or her conclusions?  What evidence is offered to support the conclusions? (Analysis of thesis should be the focus of your review, so make sure you are thorough in your discussion)
        
3) 
            SOURCES - discuss the sources used in writing the book. Does the author use a wide variety of sources - are they mostly primary or secondary? Are controversial statements made by the author documented or otherwise verified?  Examining the footnotes or endnotes as well as the bibliography or bibliographic essay on sources is important for this section.
        

4) 
            ORGANIZATION - how is the work organized; is it chronological or topical? You could include a statement here about the use of graphs, photos, maps etc.  You also might comment here, but do not have to, on whether or not the organization appears logical to you.
        

5) 
            EVALUATION - this is where you give your opinion of the book's positives and negatives. Did you like it or not? Did the author successfully prove his or her thesis? Did he employ his sources well? Did the author contradict himself or herself (they often do). What suggestions do you have for further research? Is this a controversial book; does it attack an established school of thought on the subject in question; did it create a school of thought (what impact did it have on the understanding of the period)? Also comment on the literary quality. Was it written in a clear and interesting manner or did the work drag along?
        

Also keep in mind the audience for which the book review is being written. Different audiences require different types of reviews- For example, a review of a historical monograph published in the 
            Baltimore Sun for a general, non-professional audience will differ from one published in the 
            Journal of American History which is intended for professional historians. Your reviews should be written as if for professional historians, meaning a certain amount of historical knowledge can be assumed and things of concern to historians, such as argument, documentation, and the impact the book has on the particular field of history should be evaluated.
        

Make each word and sentence count - work on making it joy, instead of a labor, to read. Move clearly and concisely from point to point in English that flows (in doing so, be sure to avoid personal pronouns and contractions). Proofread your book review very carefully. Please beware that word processing spellcheckers miss many errors of spelling, grammar, syntax, punctuation, sentence structure, word choice, and word usage.



PLAGIARISM:
        

Plagiarism occurs when one copies directly from any source without providing quotation marks and the proper documentation to recognize the copied source, and when one paraphrases by using the ideas, patterns of presentation or wording from any source without the proper documentation to recognize the source.  You can easily avoid plagiarism by using quotation marks to enclose what has been directly copied and citing sources that have been directly copied or paraphrased.


This assignment does NOT require ANY additional reading or research other than one approved book. In fact, you are expressly FORBIDDEN to use ANY other sources—especially from the Internet! Do this assignment on your own and write in your own words. Do NOT search the Internet for information about or reviews of your book. Do NOT use any websites, databases, book reviews, reader reviews, encyclopedias, magazines, newspapers, other books, other people’s papers, AI, or ANY other source for this assignment. To receive a passing grade on this assignment, you must place QUOTATION MARKS around words that you did not write yourself and provide a parenthetical note for every source of words or ideas other than your own (as outlined above).


YOUR NAME ON YOUR BOOK REVIEW IS YOUR PROMISE THAT IT REPRESENTS 100% YOUR OWN INTELLECTUAL EFFORT UNLESS YOU EXPLICITLY ACKNOWLEDGE EVERY SOURCE.


Please don’t hesitate to consult with me in advance if you are unclear about plagiarism or other violations of Academic Integrity. Even if you use multiple sources, change some words, move some sentences around, or add some words of your own, it is still (if you do not properly identify your source) plagiarism. Likewise, even if you claim that you did not mean to plagiarize when you plagiarized, or that you meant to include quotation marks and references but you forgot, or that your computer mysteriously omitted references, or that your friend typed your paper and omitted references without your knowledge, etc., etc., etc., it is still plagiarism and it is still a violation of academic integrity.  The best way to avoid trouble is to follow instructions, set aside lots of time for this assignment, AVOID THE INTERNET, and restrict yourself to one approved book—nothing else.


A SIMPLE RULE: IF YOU COPY AND PASTE ANY WORDS FROM ANY WEBSITE INTO YOUR BOOK REVIEW, YOU WILL GET AN “F” IN THIS COURSE.


If you have any questions about the assignment, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Falls in Healthcare Settings: Research, Quality Improvement, and DNP Project Perspectives

Patient falls are critical in healthcare settings, impacting patient safety, healthcare costs, and clinical outcomes. This discussion examines nursing problems identified in nursing research studies and QI/DNP projects, highlighting the gaps in knowledge and practice. Additionally, it compares how these problems influence practice change, identifies key measurement variables, and critiques the question development tool proposed by Hicks (2024).

Nursing Problems and Gaps in Knowledge and Practice

Falls are a prevalent nursing issue in research and QI/DNP projects, but their focus differs based on purpose and methodology. Research studies aim to identify contributing factors and test interventions to reduce fall rates. A standard gap in knowledge includes insufficient evidence regarding specific interventions tailored to different patient populations (Johnson et al., 2021). Conversely, QI and DNP projects emphasize implementing evidence-based fall prevention strategies in clinical practice, exposing a gap in adherence to best practices (Smith et al., 2023). The knowledge-to-practice divides underscores the challenges in translating research findings into routine nursing care.

Comparison of Problem Presentation and Influence on Practice Change

While nursing research defines the fall problem through systematic investigation, QI and DNP projects address it through implementation science. Research often examines risk factors, such as patient comorbidities and medication interactions (Anderson & Brown, 2022), while QI projects prioritize staff training and workflow modifications (Thompson et al., 2023). Despite these differences, both approaches support evidence-based nursing practice changes. Research findings drive policy development, whereas QI projects focus on real-time improvement in clinical settings. The integration of both methodologies can foster a more comprehensive approach to fall prevention.

Key Measurement Variables

Each study or project evaluates fall prevention through distinct yet complementary measures:
· 
            Research Study: Fall incidence rate per 1,000 patient-days (Johnson et al., 2021).
        
· 
            QI Project: Compliance with fall risk assessment protocols (Smith et al., 2023).
        
· 
            DNP Project: Nurse adherence to fall prevention strategies, such as hourly rounding (Thompson et al., 2023).
        
These variables reflect the broader focus of research on outcomes, QI on process adherence, and DNP projects on behavioral interventions.

Critique of the Question Development Tool (Hicks, 2024)

Hicks (2024) introduces a structured approach for developing EBP questions, aligning problem identification, question formulation, and measurement. While the tool facilitates clarity in defining the issue, it may oversimplify complex nursing challenges, particularly in distinguishing research versus QI/DNP approaches. The tool effectively integrates PICO elements but lacks guidance on operationalizing variables for implementation projects. A refined version could incorporate additional frameworks, such as the Iowa Model or PARIHS (Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services) framework, to enhance applicability across different methodologies.

Conclusion

Addressing falls in healthcare requires an integrated approach leveraging research, QI, and DNP methodologies. Identifying knowledge and practice gaps is essential for developing effective interventions, and measurement variables must align with study objectives. While Hicks' (2024) tool provides a structured foundation, refining it to include implementation science principles could enhance its utility in bridging research and practice.

The development of nursing knowledge is an ongoing process, and nursing grand theories play a significant role in shaping the direction of nursing practice and research. Grand theories, such as those proposed by Florence Nightingale, Dorothea Orem, and Jean Watson, provide a comprehensive framework that helps guide nursing practice across various settings. These theories offer broad, general principles that are applicable across different contexts and emphasize the importance of the nurse-patient relationship, the promotion of health, and holistic care. According to Alligood (2017), grand theories contribute to the organization and systematic development of nursing knowledge, allowing for the creation of consistent and coherent care approaches. By offering a conceptual foundation, they enable nurses to assess patient situations, develop effective interventions, and improve care outcomes. Furthermore, the continued development and refinement of these grand theories foster innovation within nursing, guiding research that can lead to improved care models and better patient outcomes.
However, there is also a valid case for questioning the relevance of grand theories in modern nursing practice. As healthcare environments become more complex, with a strong focus on evidence-based practice, clinical guidelines, and the integration of new technologies, the abstract nature of grand theories may become less applicable to the day-to-day needs of nursing practice. Meleis (2018) argues that the rapid pace of medical advancements and the increasing need for specialized knowledge can render grand theories somewhat outdated. The emphasis on evidence-based practices and specific clinical models, which are based on empirical research, may be more immediately useful in addressing the dynamic demands of modern healthcare. For example, grand theories often fail to account for the intricacies of contemporary patient care, such as the management of chronic illnesses or the application of advanced technologies, which require more specific and practical approaches.
Moreover, the shift toward middle-range theories, which are more directly applicable to specific clinical situations, provides a more adaptable and context-sensitive framework for practice and research. These theories, according to Meleis (2018), offer more practical solutions to immediate nursing challenges, making them better suited for contemporary healthcare systems that are complex and ever-changing. While grand theories may still have value in providing overarching guidance for nursing, middle-range theories and evidence-based practice models may be more appropriate for addressing the specific challenges of today’s healthcare landscape.",,,,Nursing,Solution,https://www.sweetstudy.com/questions/reply-20889129

Nursing theories are philosophical constructs that attempt to explain, describe, or predict phenomena that occur during nursing care by serving as guides in clinical practice, education, and nursing research (Im, 2021). According to the philosophical level of abstraction, the body of nursing theories is composed of the metaparadigms of nursing (least specific level), grand theories, middle-range theories, and practice theories (highest level of specificity) (Im, 2021). Grand theories of nursing address global aspects of the nursing universe, examples of these theories include: General Systems Theory by Imogene King, Conservation Model by Myra Estrine Levine, Nursing Process Theory by Ida Jean Orlando, Theory of Human Becoming by Rosemarie Rizzo Parse, Adaptation Model by Sister Callista Roy, Emancipated Decision Making in Health Care by Wittman-Price, Self-Care Theory by Dorothea Orem (Im, 2021). The development of the grand theories of nursing was a momentous step in the development of nursing and the attainment of an identity (Im, 2021). They were initially used as theoretical frameworks in clinical practice and research; however, their high level of abstraction limited their applicability (Im, 2021). Many of these theories are now considered obsolete because they are very abstract and their adaptation to specific clinical crossroads is not very useful (Im, 2021). In the research branch, the grand theories have lost steam as well, especially in a modern research field more focused on evidence (Im, 2021). Midrange theories have taken over the role those grand theories once played as more specific and more detailed philosophical constructs about nursing phenomena, and clinicians and researchers find midrange theories to be a more accurate guide to decision-making (Wijaya et al., 2022). Although grand theories of nursing are considered obsolete in current practice, they were a milestone in the development of nursing as a scientific discipline with its own identity. ",,,,Nursing,Adv,https://www.sweetstudy.com/questions/reply-for-nursing-theories

This is topic i chose : The Argument for Forgiving Student Loans

Student loan debt has now become one of the most significant economic burdens on millions of Americans, preventing them from achieving economic mobility and financial security in the long term. With tuition prices showing no signs of decreasing, canceling student loan debt has never been more critical. This essay contends that student loan forgiveness would relieve economic stress, speed up economic growth, and be an educational equity dividend. The weight of US student loan debt has grown to $1.7 trillion, equating to not being able to afford a home, save for the future, or accumulate wealth. The Center for American Progress and Roosevelt Institute found that eliminating student loan debt would not adversely impact disposable income and be good for the economy.

It would be advantageous to middle- and working-class families if working-class families can keep more disposable income.
The primary complaint against loan forgiveness is that penalizing those who never borrowed is a bad fiscal decision. Nevertheless, a National Bureau of Economic Research study discovered that current payment programs fail and produce debt traps that destroy economic liberty. Also, government investment in education has been a driver of economic success in the past, so forgiveness is a sound investment for the future.

Student loan forgiveness is needed, but it needs to be accompanied by tuition reform and improved financial aid to avoid future debt crises. Student loans are not just an economic issue; student loans are also a question of rights and capacity. Hence, by enacting loan forgiveness laws, lawmakers can help create a future that is fairer and richer for everyone.

Requirements

700-1000 words long (excluding sources, citations, and quotes)
have at least 5 sources
use in text citations
Go beyond course material presented

You will need to submit a document containing 5 annotated sources that you will use in your final paper
in addition to a one paragraph summary on what your paper will be about. For each source you will
need to include:
• Source citation
• One paragraph summary about the source (see below for example)
• A brief description of how you plan to utilize the source
After you have found five good sources you will need to write one paragraph describing what your paper
will be about.
Some good places to find sources include:
1. Global Issues in Context
2. Academic Search Complete
3. Subject database in your subject area.
4. ICC’s library
5. I-Shares library system
6. Your local library
7. CQ Researcher
8. Opposing Viewpoints
9. SIRS Researcher.
10. Newspapers: Access World News (Newsbank), Chicago Sun Times, and Peoria Journal Star.
The Access World News source should be an international newspaper source.
11. Advocacy websites: An advocacy website argues a specific opinion about an issue. For
example, www.naral.org argues for the pro-choice abortion position and www.nrlc.org
argues against abortion. Find two advocacy websites which are polar opposites on your
issue to include in your bibliography. CQ Researcher really helps with this category.
Example:
1. Berry, Wendell. “Faustian Economics: Hell hath no limits.” Harper’s Magazine. May, 2008.
https://harpers.org/archive/2008/05/faustian-economics/. Accessed 9 October 2017.
In Wendell Berry’s article “Faustian Economics: Hell hath no limits,” he believes human greed and
wastefulness are sustaining the illusion that we have no limits. Berry argues, however, that we must
begin thinking of ourselves, our place in this world as humans, as limited. He compares Faust making a
deal with the devil with our making a deal with nature. We exploit finite, limited resources such as oil,
coal, and forests to satiate our immediate desires, but fail to consider the lasting impact our decisions
have on future resources. In short, the oil is gone forever once it is used. Berry’s answer to being
limited but acting unlimited is to look to the arts, not the sciences and technology, for our pathway
toward limits in this world. He believes these limits actually open up our world, not “confine” it. Once
we learn our limits, we as humans will be much better off.
I plan to use this source to illustrate how the current economic models used generally ignore the idea
that the world contains a finite amount of materials.

DISCUSSION FEEDBACK
WEEK 1 – 74%
In this assignment, you discussed innovation, exploitation of workers, and class struggle. All of these are important ideas in the work of Karl Marx. And the information you provided in this initial assignment is accurate. The assignment is also clearly written. However, it is too brief to give you an opportunity to display your understanding of the work of Marx. It barely met the 600-word limit. As noted in the instructions for the assignment 
 
""The minimum length requirement for your responses to the discussion questions in order to earn any credit is 600 words (does not include references). Not surprisingly, the most effective responses to discussion questions well-exceed the minimum. ""
 
In moving forward, I need you to present more specific information Incorporated and cited from the course material. You only have a single piece of information in each of the first three paragraphs in Part A. Keep in mind that this course provides you with an opportunity to develop the ability to respond effectively to the questions on the comprehensive exam you will be taking at the end of your program. The more thorough and detailed your responses are to those questions, the more likely you are to have a successful outcome. And remember that when you take the exam you will not have access to notes or any other resources. I posted a sample student discussion question response for everyone to review to give them an idea of what the expectations are regarding successful analyses. Please make sure to review this essay before doing the assignment for next week.
In Part B you demonstrated critical thinking in discussing each of the three concepts in the context of modern American capitalism. You also used information from all three required sources. To improve upon this in your future work I need you to more thoroughly cite the source of the information you present to support your opinion and explain what you mean. For instance, you wrote:
 
""The free market makes it easy for organizations to exploit workers.""
 
This is a very good point but you need to tell your readers how the freeness of the market facilitates the exploitation of workers. What is it about the modern free market that allows companies to take advantage of the workers in those companies? Present the information on this and follow it with a citation.
You earned credit for your replies to your classmates. But please keep in mind that to earn the maximum 30 points you must incorporate, cite, and reference at least two pieces of information from the course material in each of your replies, as per the grading rubric.
If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to connect with me.
WEEK 2 – 81%
The first two sections of Part A are really significant improvements in the extent to which the descriptions are thorough and well-developed. The third paragraph on religion is more brief and could benefit from additional information. Try to be consistent in fully developing each section of our assignments.
In Part B you demonstrated critical thinking in drawing some connections between the three concepts and crime in modern society. However, the instructions for Part B state the following:
 

""In section B, in addition to information from the textbook, you must also use information on crime in modern America from at least two outside sources. ""

 
You did include information from outside sources in Part B, but you did not include anything from the textbook. Always go back and reread the instructions after completing your draft. This will help you to avoid leaving parts out.
Finally, you have cited all of the quoted passages in your analysis. However, you have numerous paraphrased passages for which no citations were provided. As I indicated in the video for the Module 1 assignment (at 2:22), you must cite not only quoted information but paraphrased information as well. This is information you have taken from a source but rewritten entirely in your own words. Here is an example. You wrote:
 
""Another idea from Durkheim’s work is that social life is religious. The purpose of religious ceremonies is to worship social life. Religions enhance cohesion among members of a society. They reaffirm ideas and sentiments that bring members of a society together. Religious ceremonies enable members to stick together.""
 
This is accurate and in paraphrased form, but you haven't followed it with a citation. The only citation you have in that paragraph is for a quoted passage. Failing to cite paraphrased information is plagiarism, so please focus on this in our subsequent assignments. If anything about this is still unclear, please connect with me so that I can provide whatever additional clarification you need.
In the Module 2 discussion assignment, you earned credit for your replies. But please remember that you can earn the full 30 points by incorporating, citing, and referencing at least two pieces of information from the course material in each of your replies.
WEEK 3 – 47%
In the first paragraph of Part A you discussed class and used information to support this part of the discussion from one of the textbook articles by Weber. The second paragraph of Part A uses information from the commentary by Garner and Hancock (p. 103) and from the article by Ritzer (p. 119) rather than by Weber (Ritzer was not part of the assigned reading). The third paragraph, on capitalism, uses information one piece of information from The Spirit of Capitalism but also once again from the commentary by Garner and Hancock instead of the writings of Weber. As you know from the assignment instructions, they asked you to:
 

""You have three assigned readings from Weber (see ""Things to do""). One idea/concept must come from each of them.""

 
In moving forward, in Part A of our assignments, you need to incorporate and cite plenty of information from the assigned articles by the theorists, not from the commentary by Garner and Hancock or from articles that have not been assigned. Remember that Part A of the assignment is your opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge of the work of the theorists.
Part B is designed to give you an opportunity to demonstrate critical thinking. You have tried to do this by drawing connections between banks and Weber's ideas. However, please remember that the information you present to support each of these sections of Part B must come from the sources cited to support that information. For instance, in describing banks you wrote:
 

""They have professionals with expertise in various fields. Individuals are hired and promoted based on merit (Besley et al. 2022, p.39""


But after reviewing the Besley et al. article there is nothing in it about banks and hiring on merit (or about banks and hiring at all).
In the third paragraph of Part B you wrote:
 

""Bank workers uphold ethical values such as honesty, accountability, professionalism, and confidentiality. Their work ethics leads to higher team productivity and individual performance (Hudson, 2021, p.558).""

 
But there is nothing about bank workers or ethical values leading to higher productivity in the Hudson article. Presenting information and then citing it to sources that do not contain that information is a violation of the Troy University academic integrity policy. In light of this, I cannot give you credit for Part B of the assignment unless you can show me where in those two articles the information can be found. If you can demonstrate this, I will be more than happy to revise the grade for this assignment. 
In moving forward, please remember that the information you present must be accurately cited to the sources of that information. In addition, in Part A of our assignments, please focus on providing thorough and detailed descriptions of the work of the theorists from the writing of the theorists as specified in the assignment instructions. I am always available to answer any questions if there is anything in the instructions for our assignments that is not clear to you.
With regard to replies to classmates, I gave you credit for your reply to Ana, but I could not give you credit for the reply to Winston, as you cited on page 186. But in your reply to me, you indicated that page 181 should be p. 105. If that is true, then there cannot be information on Weber on page 186. If you can explain this issue, I will rethink credit for the reply to Winston.

WEEK 4 – 89%
This is a significant improvement over last week. Good work overall on Part A of the assignment. The sections on the sick role and on Merton were the most well-developed. The opening section is accurate but more brief. In Part B, you did effective work in trying to draw some connections between the concepts described in Part A and modern social conditions. The point about the mechanisms through which we learn and internalize values, such as through schools and families, is right on the mark. In the final paragraph of Part B you wrote about ""eliminate the effective social constraint over means employed to this end."" This is certainly true, but this application does not mention the disjunction between goals and means that lead to the deviant behavior that is not effectively controlled.
You did an effective job in replying to your classmates on their Module 4 posts and earned the majority of points. But please remember that you can earn all of the points by incorporating, citing, and referencing at least two pieces of information from the course material in each of your required replies.

WEEK 5 – 100%
This is your best assignment of the term thus far. You did an outstanding job in both describing the date and making connections between the events associated with the date and the work of the two theorists, Becker and Goffman. This demonstrates both an understanding of key elements in the work of the two theorists as well as critical thinking in applying their ideas to a specific social circumstance, in this case a date. Thank you for your work on this!
Your replies to your classmates for the Module 5 discussion were effective and incorporated and cited multiple pieces of information from the course material to support each of your responses. You earned the full 30 points for this part of the grading rubric for this module.

WEEK 6 – 92%
Very good work overall. The strongest sections of this assignment are the sections on social capital and habitus. The information on fields is accurate but more limited. Try to be consistent in fully developing each section in your assignments. The analysis is well supported, and you demonstrated critical thinking in Part B in applying some of his ideas to modern conditions. 
I do need to ask you not to rely on so many quotations. Quotations should be used sparingly to make a special point, and you are encouraged to use them to do so. But you have about 15 quotations in this one analysis. Please take a look at the link I provided in the Module 1 discussion instructions on how to use quoted material. I did not deduct any points for this as I did not mention it in my feedback to you previously.
For the Module 7 discussion, you earned most of the points for your replies to your classmates. We only have two more discussion assignments to do in the course. In doing them, keep in mind that you can earn the full 30 points by incorporating, citing, and referencing at least two pieces of information from the course material in each of your two required replies.

WEEK 7 – 65%
In my feedback to you last week, I provided the following guidance to help you:
 

""I do need to ask you not to rely on so many quotations. Quotations should be used sparingly to make a special point, and you are encouraged to use them to do so. But you have about 15 quotations in this one analysis. Please take a look at the link I provided in the Module 1 discussion instructions on how to use quoted material. I did not deduct any points for this as I did not mention it in my feedback to you previously.""

 
In your work this week, you ignored this guidance. Once again, you have 15 quotations in your analysis. It is difficult for me to assess your level of understanding when so much of your work is represented in passages copied from your sources.
In addition, in my feedback to you on the Module 2 assignment, I provided the following guidance:
 

""Finally, you have cited all of the quoted passages in your analysis. However, you have numerous paraphrased passages for which no citations were provided. As I indicated in the video for the Module 1 assignment (at 2:22), you must cite not only quoted information but paraphrased information as well. This is information you have taken from a source but rewritten entirely in your own words. Here is an example. You wrote:

 

""Another idea from Durkheim’s work is that social life is religious. The purpose of religious ceremonies is to worship social life. Religions enhance cohesion among members of a society. They reaffirm ideas and sentiments that bring members of a society together. Religious ceremonies enable members to stick together.""


 


This is accurate and in paraphrased form, but you haven't followed it with a citation. The only citation you have in that paragraph is for a quoted passage. Failing to cite paraphrased information is plagiarism, so please focus on this in our subsequent assignments. If anything about this is still unclear, please connect with me so that I can provide whatever additional clarification you need.""


 

This guidance has also not been followed in your Module 7 analysis. For instance, in Part A of the assignment none of the paraphrased information has been supported with a citation. Here's just one example.
 

""Different cultures have different norms that determine how gender is constructed.""

 
This paraphrased statement about different cultures having different norms is accurate, but you have failed to support it with a citation to the source of this information about different cultures. There is nothing else in that paragraph about different cultures. As you know, failing to cite the source of paraphrased information is plagiarism.
These issues that I previously provided guidance to help you avoid them re holding you back. I know very well that you are capable of doing effective work but it is essential that you follow the guidance I provide to help you be successful on our assignments. I am always available to answer questions if anything in the guidance I provide, assignment instructions, or course material is unclear to you. Please eliminate these issues in our final discussion assignment for next week.
Thank you for your responses to your classmates in the Module 7 discussion. One last time, I want to remind you that you can earn the full 30 points for this part of the grading rubric if you remember to incorporate, cite, and reference at least two pieces of information from the course material in each of your replies. This is encouraged as the more you do this, the more you are working with the concepts in the course material. And the more you ""handle"" these concepts, the more it contributes to remembering them when the time comes to take the comprehensive exam.",Social Science,Disc,https://www.sweetstudy.com/questions/help-with-disc-due-in-48-hours-20889179

1.1Discussion.WhatWouldYouDowith12MonthstoLive.docx
1.1 Discussion. What Would You Do with 12 Months to Live?

Getting Started

In this workshop assignment, you will review a portion of the documentary 
            Dr. Dave and the Girl Who Couldn’t Laugh: A Breadcrumb Quest for Joy. You will also reflect on concepts from the documentary as you begin the implementation of your Capstone Project.
        

Upon successful completion of this discussion, you will be able to:

· Integrate biblical principles with positive psychology concepts.
· Finalize your Capstone Project idea for implementation.


Background Information

""Teach us to realize the brevity of life, so that we may grow in wisdom"" (
            New Living Translation, 1996/2015, 
            
Psalm 90:12
                    (new tab)

)
        

What would you do if you had 12 Months to Live? This is what I asked myself as a way to frame a year-long project to figure out my life and calling. With verses like Psalm 90:12, I reflected on what was most important in life and what I would do if my days were numbered. 
        

Dr. Dave and the Girl Who Couldn’t Laugh is a documentary based on this 12-month life project that I completed during a period of vocational, spiritual, and personal challenge and transition.
        
It is also an example of what a personal capstone project might look like. I have found that throughout my life, about every 5 to 7 years, I have felt a need for creating a year-long experience and experiment, similar to what you have done for your Capstone Project, to help me learn, resolve, or just figure out an aspect of my life.  
            Dr. Dave and The Girl Who Couldn’t Laugh is just one example of a positive psychology intervention that you can model your own project after if you find yourself in a curious place in life as I did.
        


Instructions

1. Take brief notes as you watch this YouTube 5:16-minute clip from 
            Dr. Dave and the Girl Who Couldn’t Laugh: A Breadcrumb Quest for Joy:
            


2. Reflect on Psalm 90:12 and the above clip. Take a moment to pray.  Then write down three ideas about what you would do with 12 months to live, referencing what you learned from the documentary. 
3. Formulate your reflections, prayers, and thoughts into a discussion post that includes the following in one page (250 words):d
a. A paragraph summary of your notes on key points from the documentary.
b. Reflection on Psalm 90:12 and the documentary as you formulate a response to this question: As you consider the brevity of life, looking back and into your future, how do you want your life, reactions to others, and service to be different or stay the same?
c. List at least three items representing what you would do with 12 months to live.
4. Your initial post is due by the end of the fourth day of the workshop.
5. Read and respond to at least two of your classmates’ posts, as well as all instructor follow-up questions directed to you, by the end of the workshop.
6. Your postings should also:
a. Be well developed by providing clear answers with evidence of critical thinking.
b. Add greater depth to the discussion by introducing new ideas.

1.3 Assignment. Personal Reflection Journal

Getting Started

Throughout the MA in Psychology program, you have created and sustained three journal themes: Personal Reflection Journal; TED-style Talk Journal; and The Capstone Project Journal. In this workshop, you will review and summarize your Personal Reflection Journal assignments from the previous nine courses and then summarize the key elements as you prepare to write about what you think the Good Life means to you, which will be due in a later workshop. 

Upon successful completion of this assignment, you will be able to:

· Review and summarize key findings from your Personal Reflection Journals.
· Synthesize core aspects of what the Good Life means to you.


Background Information

Your Personal Reflection Journals began in PSY-520 with an entry you titled - 
            6.5 Personality and Lifespan Development and then in PSY-525 with 
            1.4 Exploring Cultural Insights. In each successive course, PSY-530, (not 535), 540, and 545, you added to this personal reflection journal. In this assignment, you will review each of these entries, assure that you have all of them in one Word document, and then summarize your learnings as preparation for a synthesis paper on what The Good Life means to you in an upcoming workshop.
        


Instructions

1. Open your 
            Personal Reflection Journal that you created in PSY-520 and that you have added to in five of the six core courses throughout the program. Review formatting for consistency, make sure that you have at least five entries from the foundational courses and then reflect on what you wrote.
        
2. After reviewing and correcting any formatting issues, post your 
            Personal Reflection Journal.

Research Paper: Final Assignment Instructions



Overview

Assigning a career research paper for this course serves several express purposes. First, this research will provide you with an opportunity to learn more about an occupation of particular interest to you. Second, performing this research will introduce you to the literature and the skills needed to navigate it. Third, how well your research document conforms to the required form and format will demonstrate your attention to detail and instruction. Such attention to detail is a measurable item. Finally, well-documented research will show your ability to communicate via the written word.

There are three deliverables in this assignment: Topic Selection, Annotated Bibliography, Final Paper. These are discussed briefly below.


Research Paper: Topic Selection:

The easiest approach for selecting an occupation for your research is to search the Internet for background data. Simply do a search for “Computer Technology Careers.” The most up-to-date information on this subject is found online, and this exercise will sharpen your Internet search skills.


Research Paper: Annotated Bibliography Assignment:

Occurring at the midpoint of your research is an annotated bibliography. The assignment is, exactly as the name says implies—a bibliography that includes summary comments about each resource. It serves two purposes in the research process. First, as a graded assignment, it ensures you are researching your topic early enough to improve the overall quality of your final.  Second, when done correctly, it becomes a partial draft of your final paper reference page.


Research Paper: Final Assignment

Follow all the instructions on this page and in the 
            Research Paper Template. Your ability to follow instructions is an important part of this deliverable and your grade.
        


Instructions

First, and maybe most important, a template has been provided in your course shell.  Use that template.  Students who chose another template often miss the gradable items that are built into the templates provided in the course shell.

You must maintain the format and organization of the provided template to create your document. The template exhibits the proper APA format; just make sure you keep it. You will see yellow highlighted text in the 
            Research Paper Template.  These provide comments on content required or on format.  You must delete all yellow highlights and add you own work.  
        

Your paper must be at least 6 pages (not including the Cover page and reference page). The research may include figures, tables, or diagrams, but these items (as well) are not included in the page count. 
Your 
            Research Paper: Final Assignment must be saved as a 
            Word file (.docx) file. File types other than Word will not be accepted. 
        

Note: Your assignment will be checked for originality via the Turnitin plagiarism tool.

Abstract
The abstract should be one paragraph of between 150 and 250 words. It is not indented. Section titles, such as the word Abstract above, are not considered headings so they don’t use bold heading format. Instead, use the Section Title style. This style automatically starts your section on a new page, so you don’t have to add page breaks. (To see your document with pagination, on the View tab, click Reading View.) Note that all text styles for this template are available on the Home tab of the ribbon, in the Styles gallery.

Keywords: Add keywords here. To replace this (or any) tip text with your own, just select it and then start typing. Don’t include space to the right or left of the characters in your selection.

Add Title Here, up to 12 Words, on One to Two Lines.
This starts your paper with an introduction.  APA style assumes the first paragraph is the research introduction, so it is not appropriate to have the heading of Introduction.  For a complete introduction, you would want to start by motivating the reader.  Relate your topic in a way that makes your reader want to read your research.  Second, the introduction needs to provide an outline of the paper.  Introductions are often written after the research report is completed.

Now that you have completed a Gemba Walk—where you’ve gathered information about the organization and identified opportunities to eliminate inefficiencies, reduce waste, improve a product, or streamline a process—it’s time to look closer at these potential improvements and get to the root cause of why the issues are occurring. After reviewing these potential opportunities for improvements, you will analyze how you can apply systems thinking at the strategic level for your organization in the Week 6 Summative Assessment.
For more information about how to use 5 Whys or a Fishbone diagram to conduct a root cause analysis, check out the following videos:

Individually, create either a 5 Whys or a Fishbone diagram for one of the opportunities (short-term or long-term) that you identified during your Gemba walk. Work through each step of the 5 Whys or Fishbone processes to find the root cause(s) of the problem and the potential opportunity for its solution within your organization.
Post your diagram to your team forum for review.
As a team, review each team member’s diagram and utilize the discussion to ask questions, provide input, or make suggestions on their root cause analysis.
Each member should write a 100- to 200-word summary of the feedback they received from their team as well as an explanation of why or why it did not help them refine their root cause analysis.

Analyzing Personal Bias

In this Competency, advocating for diversity, equity, and inclusion in healthcare starts at the individual level of building understanding of key concepts and awareness of personal bias that impact interactions with those you care for, as well as fellow professionals. The Competency Assessment involves reflection and analysis of your own perceptions of self and others and for uncovering and addressing personal biases—all to further your efforts to be a champion of diversity, equity, and inclusion. There are no right or wrong answers in this Assessment. Rather, the aim is thorough and thoughtful responses.

To Prepare:

· Access the Analyzing Personal Bias template document. Review the required content to provide.
· Review the Module 1 and Module 2 Learning Resources for support in framing your analysis.
· Complete the Module 2 Exploratory activity: Learning Activity 3. You are required to choose at least three (3) tests of implicit bias. You are not required to share your test results as part of the Competency Assessment. However, your honest analysis of those results is encouraged.

In what ways does creativity show up in marketing these days?," What unique things does marketing do? Is it more imagination or fresh thoughts? Is a creative marketer more like a businessperson or an artist? As of late, ""marketing creative"" has been used to refer to the copy and images that go into ads. But marketing, like many other business jobs, has gotten harder and more complicated. Marketers need to be able to look at data, figure out what customers want, and make goods. You have to be on the ball and quick on your feet in Doodle Jump  because you'll have to avoid falling every time you come across a broken or moving platform. When you have to precisely plan every leap, it makes for some intense moments.

The ongoing development of nursing knowledge is essential for advancing both nursing practice and research. Nursing grand theories, such as Orem’s Self-Care Deficit Theory and Roy’s Adaptation Model, have historically provided comprehensive frameworks for addressing complex patient needs across diverse clinical settings. These theories guide nursing practice by emphasizing the importance of holistic care, which integrates the physical, emotional, and psychological needs of patients. However, as the healthcare landscape evolves, the relevance of these grand theories in contemporary nursing practice has been called into question due to the shift toward evidence-based practice (EBP), which is more focused on actionable and measurable outcomes (Schultz et al., 2022).
             Supporters of the ongoing use and development of nursing grand theories argue that they provide an overarching structure for understanding the complexity of human health and behavior. For example, Roy’s Adaptation Model has been applied to a wide range of healthcare settings to guide nurses in assessing patients' ability to adapt to illness and other health challenges (Roy et al., 2021). Recent evidence shows that the use of grand theories can lead to improved outcomes in nursing practice. In a study by Zhang et al. (2021), the application of Roy’s Adaptation Model in the care of elderly patients in long-term care facilities enhanced patient satisfaction, improved care coordination, and led to better health outcomes. This indicates that grand theories still offer valuable guidance in certain contexts, particularly when addressing holistic patient care.
              Despite this, critics argue that the abstract nature of grand theories makes them difficult to implement in today’s highly specialized and dynamic clinical environments. With the increasing reliance on technology and data-driven approaches in modern healthcare, nurses are often expected to apply evidence-based guidelines that provide specific, targeted interventions for particular conditions. For example, clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management and wound care are evidence-based and grounded in research, providing nurses with concrete tools for improving patient outcomes (Melnyk et al., 2020). Studies have shown that evidence-based practices lead to more effective, measurable patient outcomes compared to theoretical models alone (Fitzpatrick & Wallace, 2020).
         Furthermore, the shift toward EBP is supported by research that emphasizes the need for clinical decisions to be based on the best available evidence rather than abstract theories. Melnyk et al. (2020) found that EBP improves nursing care by reducing complications, decreasing healthcare costs, and enhancing overall patient outcomes. This research highlights the importance of a practical, evidence-driven approach to nursing care, which often contrasts with the broad, generalized nature of grand theories.
              In conclusion, while nursing grand theories have historically contributed to the development of nursing knowledge, the growing emphasis on evidence-based practice suggests that these theories must evolve or be complemented by more specific, evidence-driven approaches. Nurses should continue to integrate grand theories into their practice where applicable, but also embrace evidence-based practices to ensure that patient care is both effective and measurable in today’s fast-paced healthcare environment.

Knowledge in nursing is constantly developing and very dynamic. The grand nursing theories have played a central role in this evolution as they laid the foundations: conceptual frameworks that have guided practice, education, and research. However, we now ask ourselves: is it pertinent to continue using these theories today? Have they become obsolete in the face of the contemporary needs and realities of the profession? To guide this analysis, let's look at both sides of the coin: the arguments for and against.
First, it must be said that great nursing theories offer a holistic view of nursing care. These theoretical knowledge bodies allow nurses to understand and address patients' needs comprehensively. They facilitate the systematization of practice and ensure that interventions are based on solid and coherent foundations. Nursing practice and research are guided and structured by these nursing models and theories, which have historically served as the basis for nursing education (Maxwell, 2023). How can we ensure preparation in nursing if we do not know how the thinking of our predecessors on health, care, patient, environment, and nursing evolved? These theories ensure that future professionals acquire an understanding of the basic principles of the discipline. Properly applying theories in practice facilitates comprehensive approaches aimed at patient-centered care (Maxwell, 2023).
But why do some professionals argue that great nursing theories may not be fully adapted to the current complexities and challenges of clinical practice? The rigidity of some of them could limit the ability of nurses to respond flexibly and effectively to emerging situations and the changing needs of patients. The evolution of science and technology in health demands more dynamic and specific theoretical frameworks that can be easily integrated into evidence-based practice (Roy, 2021). So, despite the substantial theoretical framework that supports and guides the work of nurses, these are of relegated importance in professional practice, which suggests the need to update and adapt existing theories. In addition, cultural diversity and variations in health systems globally require more contextualized and adaptable approaches (Roy, 2021). Hence, middle-range theories and situation-specific theories have emerged as more applicable alternatives to particular contexts (Roy, 2021). These, more focused, favor the prescription of practice and theoretical verification (Maxwell, 2023). The combination of traditional theoretical frameworks with new perspectives is the actual formula for offering more effective, personalized care based on scientific evidence. Knowing how to generate new knowledge and integrate the positive aspects of all eras will lead us to excellence in our practice.

Such a plan defines the critical elements of who, what, when, where, and why that establish the foundation for an effective clinical learning experience for the participants. Completing this assessment will strengthen your understanding of how to plan and negotiate individual or group participation. The two windshield survey worksheets will be critical steps in completing this assessment. This assessment is the foundation for the implementation of Assessment 4, Health Promotion Plan Presentation.

Note: Assessment 1 must be completed first before you are able to submit Assessment 4. Complete the assessments in this course in the order in which they are presented.
        

Preparation

Be sure you've completed the Windshield Survey Worksheet 1: Assess Your Community and Windshield Survey Worksheet 2: Tour Your Community activities. Then complete this assessment as if within a neighborhood or community of your choice. Your community, which will become the focus of your health promotion plan, could be something like the elderly housing center, high school, or your own neighborhood. It could even be a subset of or an individual within that community, for instance, one of the students at the high school or a resident at the elderly housing center.

Instructions

Complete the following:
· Assess your chosen community to include socioeconomic and demographic data such as location, lifestyle, age, race, ethnicity, gender, marital status, income, education, employment. (Complete the windshield surveys first.)
· Choose a specific health concern or health need from the

 as the focus of your health promotion plan for your chosen community. Then, analyze a population within your community with the health concern or need you've chosen to focus on and the best practices for health improvement, based on supporting evidence. Consider underlying assumptions and points of uncertainty in your analysis.
        
· Describe in detail the characteristics of your chosen community who will be the audience for the activity you are planning and how those characteristics are relevant to what you've learned about the targeted population. Describe in detail the relevant information of who within this community is affected by your chosen health issue.
· Explain why the population you are focusing on in your community is predisposed to this health concern or health need and why they can benefit from a health promotion educational plan. Consider the factors that contribute to health, health disparities, and access to services. Support your conclusions with relevant population health and demographic data.
· Based on the health concern for your individual or group, discuss what you would include in the development of a sociogram. Take into consideration possible social, economic, cultural, genetic, and/or lifestyle behaviors that may have an impact on health as you develop your educational plan in this assessment. You will take this information into consideration when you present your educational plan in Assessment 4.
· Identify your chosen individual's or group's potential learning needs. Imagine the input of your audience if you were collaborating with the individual or group to establish the SMART goals that would be used to evaluate the education session (Assessment 4).
· Identify the individual or group's current behaviors, outline clear expectations for this educational session, and offer suggestions for how the individual or group needs can be met. Health promotion goals need to be clear, measurable, and appropriate for this activity and audience. Consider goals that will foster behavior changes and lead to the desired outcomes.
Be sure to apply APA formatting to in-text citations and references exhibiting nearly flawless adherence to APA format.

""Nursing stakeholder engagement is an essential component of human resources for health planning processes, and the gap in literature points to a need for up‐to‐date guidance to ensure nurses’ active involvement"" (North et al., 2022). Being a nurse influences my role as a healthcare consumer by allowing me to discuss further healthcare options with providers. Whether this discussion is professional or personal, being a part of the healthcare system gives me a unique perspective on the processes that should be followed to treat a client appropriately. Knowing some about the U.S. Healthcare system can help me assist other stakeholders by assisting them in reviewing policies and procedures they may not understand. 
""Always remember, your voice as a practicing nurse can guide policy and influence changes that may significantly impact patient safety and overall patient outcomes"" (What Are the Impacts of Health Policy on Nursing?, 2024). As nurses, our voices can have the most impact on implementing new policies and procedures or modifying existing policies and procedures. As consumers and providers, we have a unique position to be involved on the frontlines of an ever-changing healthcare system.

#2
 
1. As a nurse, you wear at least two or more stakeholder hats; how does being a nurse influence your role as a consumer of healthcare?
Being a nurse definitely influences how I approach my own healthcare. I’m more aware of what’s going on medically, which often leads me to wait to seek care—sometimes a bit too long—because I feel like I can handle things or I’m unsure if it’s serious enough. This could be a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it’s pretty common for nurses to hold off on seeking care until it’s absolutely necessary (Mason et al., 2021). I also tend to ask a lot of questions when I do go to the doctor, which might not be something every consumer is able to do. This proactive approach can be helpful, but it also highlights the disparities in patient advocacy that exist across different populations (Mason et al., 2021).
That said, navigating the U.S. healthcare system as a consumer is tough. Insurance is expensive, confusing, and hard to understand. And, honestly, many of the benefits don’t seem worth the cost of premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. Research shows that the cost of healthcare continues to rise without corresponding improvements in care quality, which leaves many consumers feeling disillusioned (Mason et al., 2021). I know the system has its flaws, but it’s frustrating to see how many people have to choose between paying for care and other basic needs. As a nurse, I understand the importance of high-quality care, but as a consumer, I’m often left questioning if the benefits justify the costs (Mason et al., 2021).
Mason et al. (2021) highlight that healthcare providers are often more aware of the barriers patients face, like the high cost of care and insurance challenges. This awareness makes me more critical of the system as a consumer because I know firsthand how these issues limit access to care for many people. The rising cost of care and insurance, along with inequities in access, are ongoing problems that affect millions of Americans (Mason et al., 2021).
As both a nurse and a consumer, I can appreciate the hard work that goes into healthcare, but the system itself is hard to navigate and too expensive for most people. The lack of accessibility and value for the cost is something that definitely stands out to me. Moving forward, we need a more transparent and equitable system that addresses both the needs of consumers and the challenges providers face (Mason et al., 2021).
2. How does your knowledge of the U.S. health care system impact how you can help other stakeholders?
As a nurse, I see the healthcare system from a unique perspective. I know how expensive and complicated it can be, but that understanding helps me better guide patients and families through the process. I can, point them to resources like financial assistance programs, explain highlights of insurance, and make the system feel less overwhelming (Mason et al., 2021). I also use what I know to help my colleagues understand the challenges patients face and encourage compassion.
My experience also gives me a voice in advocating for policy changes that could make healthcare more affordable and accessible. I’ve seen firsthand how the system can make it harder for people to get the care they need, and I want to be part of the solution (Mason et al., 2021).
In short, my knowledge of the U.S. healthcare system helps me be a better advocate for patients, support my colleagues, and push for broader change to make healthcare more accessible and affordable.
3. Explain the various sphere(s) of influence (consumer, provider, etc.) that would be the most impactful in advancing healthcare policy initiatives and explain why.
To push for meaningful healthcare policy change, the consumer, provider, and policy-maker spheres are all essential.
Consumers, including patients and the public, have a huge impact. When they speak out and push for change—whether it’s about costs, coverage, or access—they can force policymakers to take action. Their votes and advocacy are key to influencing healthcare reforms that directly affect their lives (Mason et al., 2021).
Healthcare providers like nurses and doctors are also crucial in shaping policy. We understand firsthand what works and what doesn’t in the system, and we can use our voices to advocate for changes. Our input helps ensure that policies are practical and focused on improving care.
Lastly, policy-makers are the ones who actually make and implement the laws. But their decisions are influenced by what consumers and providers push for. Effective policy-makers listen to both groups to create policies that truly work.
All these spheres need to work together. Consumers drive demand, providers give real-world insights, and policy-makers make the changes happen.",,,,Nursing,Nurse ,https://www.sweetstudy.com/questions/week-1re

Nursing problems implicit in the nursing research study and the QI DNP project.


Nursing research explores nursing problems to prepare nurses for what to expect in nursing practice. The nursing problems in the QI DNP project and research study focus on gaps in practice and knowledge. The research study by Emsden et al. (2020) highlights a knowledge gap in pain assessment in patients who cannot speak, such as unconscious or intubated patients, by questioning the effectiveness of the current tools that focus on providing verbal responses. The QI DNP project by Hicks (2024), on the other hand, address a gap in practice by highlighting the increased prevalence of central line-associated bloodstream infections at a specific healthcare facility. These two problems are critical because they directly affect patient outcomes. However, they address different areas of healthcare improvement because they focus on expanding knowledge by validating tools and reviewing the implementation of evidence-based practices to reduce infection rates.


How the nursing problems define the gap in knowledge (research) and the gap in practice (QI and DNP projects) and a comparison and contrast of how the problems are presented and potentially influence a positive nursing practice change.


The nature of nursing problems defines the gaps in practice and knowledge. For example, in the research study, the knowledge gap is highlighted by the need to validate the tools used to assess patients for patients who cannot speak, thus bridging the knowledge gap in patient care. Addressing this gap can result in the development of better pain assessment tools, which will lead to improved patient outcomes. On the other hand, the QI DNP project identifies a gap in practice by reviewing the ineffective control of CLABSI rates. This creates a need to review and improve the current practices used to manage CLABSI. These gaps create opportunities to improve healthcare delivery by offering new knowledge. For example, the research study influences change by introducing new information that can be applied to patient care. Consequently, the QI DNP project drives changes through improved practices. However, the research study enhances nursing practice differently because it contributes to developing new theories, while the QI initiatives focus on practical improvements.


Key measurement/variable used in each of the three studies/projects.


The three studies reviewed this week have different key measurements/variables. For example, the key variable in the research study is the accuracy of the Critical Care Pain Observation Tool in assessing pain in patients who cannot speak. The critical variable in the QI DNP project is the occurrence of CLABSI as the primary measurement, evaluating the effectiveness of the interventions in reducing infection rates. The crucial variable in the third study by Bangura (2024) is the fall rate among patients. This variable creates the foundation for the study because it guides the researcher in evaluating the effectiveness of the current strategies used to prevent patient falls.


Critique of the question development tool presented in terms of the problem, the EBP question, and the measurement (Hicks, 2024).


The question development tool presented in the study by Hicks (2024) effectively connects the problem, EBP question, and measurement. The tool offers a structured approach to identifying and aligning a problem with an outcome that can be measured through QI projects and research. However, the tool is rigid, thus limiting the scope of study to predefined outcomes, possibly overlooking emergent variables that could be important. Therefore, the tool can be improved by making it more flexible to adjust to unforeseen variables during a project or research study.

Descriptive Epidemiology: Data Sources and Data Collection



Descriptive epidemiology deals with describing disease patterns using three major categories: person, place, or time (Friis & Sellers, 2021). Consider the following example:
Over the last weekend, six people went to the Alcan City Hospital emergency room with similar symptoms. The laboratory results for the six patients were indicative of an infection due to Escherichia coli (E. coli). Patient interviews revealed they had all eaten a meal at Sam’s Sandwich Food Truck during the Alcan City Fair within 48 hours of going to
the hospital. Further inquiries by the Alcan City public health officials identified that the source of the E. coli contamination was the lettuce that Sam’s had purchased from M&L Produce (a produce supplier located in Tempe, Arizona). Epidemiologists from the Arizona State Health Department determined that the lettuce that M&L supplied Sam’s was from a farm located in Xion, California (the key supplier for M&L Produce).
Aside from the six patients who sought treatment, epidemiologists tracked down and conducted interviews with 400 of the fair attendees to identify any potential cases who did not seek treatment and compare data with those who attended but did not become ill. Interview questions pertained to descriptive aspects of the outbreak (person, place, and time). Analysis of data collected on foods eaten allowed the epidemiologists to narrow it down and identify sandwiches served by Sam’s
Sandwich Food Truck at the fair on Saturday as the source of infection. Alcan City public health officials were quick to visit the food truck to inquire into their food management and handling. The food truck owner was cooperative and helpful in providing licensing, permits, operations, and sales information.
Descriptive epidemiologic studies are often conducted as precursors to analytic studies. Epidemiologic concepts are used to gather data to better understand and evaluate health trends in populations. Data, such as characteristics of the persons affected, place where an incident occurred, and time of occurrence, are collected and analyzed to look for patterns in an effort to identify emerging health problems. It was in just this way that the HIV/AIDS epidemic was first identified.
In this Discussion, you will apply the epidemiologic concepts of time, place, and person to a specific population health problem. You will also consider methods for obtaining data to study an issue.

HIV in Prison Populations


Person

HIV disproportionately affects Black men in prison, especially those who have sex with men (MSM). This population faces significant healthcare barriers and shows higher HIV rates than the general population (Hoff et al., 2022; Ndeffo-Mbah et al., 2018).

Place

Prison environments facilitate disease transmission due to confined conditions.
Institutional barriers limit access to HIV testing, treatment, and prevention services (Ndeffo-Mbah et al., 2018; Kuester & Freestone, 2021). Transitions between prison and communities disrupt care continuity (Friis & Sellers, 2021).

Time

Incarceration duration affects healthcare continuity, while repetition complicates sustained HIV treatment. Some individuals report seeking reimprisonment to access healthcare unavailable in their communities (Kuester & Freestone, 2021).
Addressing this health disparity requires population-based approaches that consider individual, community, and structural factors (Curley, 2024).

Primary Collection Strategies

Stratified random sampling organizes the incarcerated population into demographic subgroups before random selection, enabling representative sampling while facilitating comparison between groups (Friis & Sellers, 2021). Respondent-driven sampling leverages peer networks through chain-referral techniques with statistical adjustments, proving especially valuable for accessing populations typically underrepresented in traditional sampling frameworks (Friis & Sellers, 2021).

Secondary Data Resources

Institutional health records document clinical encounters, treatment regimens, and medication compliance (Curley, 2024), though diagnostic protocols may lack standardization across facilities. The CDC HIV surveillance infrastructure maintains consistent reporting standards and demographic documentation
nationwide (Friis & Sellers, 2021), but relies on testing participation, potentially missing undiagnosed cases.

Implications for Case Assessment

Data collection methodologies substantially impact case identification carefulness. While primary collection may detect cases overlooked by standard surveillance, institutional records capture only those formally diagnosed. Case definitions similarly vary, with national surveillance employing uniform criteria while facility-based records may reflect resource constraints and local protocols (Curley, 2024). A multi-method approach yields the most comprehensive epidemiological understanding, capturing both diagnosed and undiagnosed infections while acknowledging the unique contextual factors shaping disease patterns in correctional environments.

Conclusion

HIV in prison populations, showing how incarcerated individuals especially Black men who have sex with men face higher infection risks in confined settings (Hoff et al., 2022). Two primary data collection methods (stratified random sampling and respondent-driven sampling) complement secondary sources like prison health records and CDC surveillance data (Friis & Sellers, 2021). The choice of data collection method affects both case identification and definition consistency. A combined approach offers the most complete picture of HIV patterns in correctional settings, providing a foundation for targeted interventions (Curley, 2024).

Guidelines for Creating a Podcast

This Competency Assessment requires submission of three (3) files:
 • Podcast Planning template document (Word file) 
• Podcast Recording (audio or video file of 5–7 minutes in length) 
• Podcast Transcript (text file) Review the following guidelines for the steps in creating your podcast. 
Step 1: Podcast Planning Planning is key to a successful podcast. The Podcast Planning template document will support this process and enable you to demonstrate for the Competency Assessment the learning and thought you put into preparing for your podcast interview. Review and complete the following requirements.
Identify a Professional to Interview Choose your expert based on the following requirements. The individual is: 
• A member of your specific healthcare field, or someone who can speak with authority to your field 
• Recognized within your facility, community, region, or beyond as an expert on the topics of principles of professional–patient relationships for integrating social justice and human rights into practice 
• Available to meet in person or to be recorded remotely within your time period for completing this Competency. Important Note: An interview via email, text, or social media is not accepted.
Prepare a brief profile of the professional to support your selection and for introducing the individual on your podcast. 
Note: When you contact the expert to request the interview, be sure to confirm the following: 
1. Date, time, and approximate length of the interview 
2. How the interview will be conducted—in person or via remote connection 
3. Permission granted by the expert for an audio or video recording of the interview, which will be submitted to your instructor.
Set the Interview Purpose Think ahead to the primary purpose of your interview. For example, you might mainly aim to inform or persuade your audience of the need to integrate social justice and human rights into practice. Or you might aim to provide concrete strategies for doing so. Use your understanding of needs in your healthcare field to help determine your purpose.
Investigate the Interview Topics As the podcast interviewer, you want to have a solid background on the topics you will discuss with your expert. The Learning Resources provided for this Competency support developing your understanding of core principles of professional–patient relationships for integrating social justice and human rights into practice. The Podcast Planning template document will guide you with questions for demonstrating your understanding of key topics in preparation for the podcast interview.
Develop Your interview Questions Draw on the knowledge you have gained on the topics of principles of professional–patient relationships for integrating social justice and human rights into practice to identify three to five (3–5) questions to ask the expert. Keep these tips in mind: 1. Draft questions that support your interview purpose. 
2. Frame open-ended questions—such as how and why questions—to encourage detailed answers. 
3. Add follow-up questions that will invite the expert to dig deeper into a topic with more details. 
Note: You may choose to share your questions in advance with the expert. However, discourage your expert from scripting answers, to avoid long monologues and promote a conversation between the two of you. Instead, recommend preparing by creating a bulleted list of talking points.
In advance, estimate how much time to allot for each portion of the podcast to meet your 5- to 7-minute goal. Time your portions of the podcast for an idea of how many minutes you will have for your expert’s responses. For example: 
• Welcome listeners. 
• Explain the main theme of the podcast. 
• Provide a brief introduction and professional bio of your expert guest. 
• Ask the first question. 
• Expert responds. 
• Ask a follow-up to the first question or ask the second question. 
• Expert responds. 
• Ask a follow-up question or ask the third question. 
• Expert responds. 
• Continue with additional questions and responses as you have time. 
• Wrap up by thanking your guest. 
Note: Be sure to ask your most important questions first to ensure they are addressed in your interview.

Discussion 1: Discussion 1 Ms. Blessing is a... | Nursing,"Discussion 1
Ms. Blessing is a 68-year-old widow who has been a patient of her primary care physician (PCP), Dr. Le, for more than 10 years. She has a history of anemia, osteoarthritis, diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure—and is a recent victim of home invasion and rape. She was referred to the mental health acute care clinic for evaluation of complaints of not being able to sleep for days, and she reports feeling ""nervous all the time."" Her daughter states that Ms. Blessing is ""unable to stop thinking about the night; it has been 4 months since the home invasion and her rape,"" and she has become ""more and more like this."" The patient lives alone and is independent, but her daughter reports she has become more and more nervous and jumpy, cries easily, and exhibits more helpless behaviors that have become more pronounced since her assault. On interview, she is tearful, shaking, trembling, and overtly distressed. She keeps her eyes on the floor or her lap most of the time, and then wrings her hands as she answers questions about the event. ""I just keep seeing him,"" she says, ""And I'm constantly checking my doors to make sure they're locked."" She holds back tears discussing her challenges with sleep, specifically being able to sleep at night while fearing the rapist will return. She offers apologies for having to talk about this matter, saying, ""I have the best daughter and family. I just need to get some sleep. I will be okay.""
Self-Assessment
The nurse assigned to Ms. Blessing is Angela Juarez, a new graduate who has been at the mental health clinic for the past several months. She has a calm demeanor and is known to be a good listener. Although Nurse Juarez has never worked with a patient with PTSD, after her initial meeting with Ms. Blessing, she thought that her best approach would be to offer a comfort and caring response, especially because Ms. Blessing offers apologetic pleas for help with insomnia. Nurse Juarez plans to allow Ms. Blessing to verbalize her concerns without interruption. Angela speaks to her nurse supervisor about her approach, and the supervisor recognizes that Angela's planned approach will support a foundation for a therapeutic alliance with Ms. Blessing and allows her to continue with intervention. This includes:
Outcomes Identification
The patient will develop effective coping skills or patterns to reduce anxiety. The patient will secure a normal activity and rest schedule.
Planning
Because of the patient's known cardiac history, she is admitted to a 23-hour bed for further assessment of physical status and for guidance related to her response to prescribed medication to treat anxiety and insomnia. The nurse plans interventions that will help reduce Ms. Blessing's anxiety and offer information related to self-help techniques to reduce anxiety and promote sleep, as well as the education about and administration of medications to reduce anxiety and promote sleep.
Implementation
Nurse Angela makes the following nursing care plan.
Short-Term Goal
Patient will self-report a reduction in anxiety symptoms and ability to rest without interruption for at least 4 hours within 23 hours.
Intervention

Help patient recognize early signs of anxiety (eg, dyspnea, chest pain, rapid pulse).
Administer low-dose antihistamine hydroxyzine pamoate (Vistaril) as ordered.
Administer daily dose at bedtime to promote sleep.
Monitor mental status with antihistamine dosing.
Place the patient in a private or quiet room (whenever possible).
Stay with the patient and ensure the patient’s safety with the introduction of new medication.

Rationale

The sooner the patient recognizes the onset of anxiety, the more quickly she will be able to alter her response.
Antihistamines are one of the most common classes of sleep-inducing agents; they are also a commonly used medication to treat concurrent anxiety.
This may minimize adverse effects and allow more normal daytime activities to occur.
Older adults may experience delirium secondary to adverse effects.
Environmental stimuli and distractibility are minimized.
Elder response to medication could result in oversedation; monitor vital signs and fall risk.

Evaluation
GOAL MET

After receiving the first dose of antihistamine, the patient states that she feels less jittery and was noted closing eyes and resting comfortably.
Nurse noted patient asleep in bed with half rails up and daughter sitting bedside.

Short-Term Goal
Patient will sleep or rest 4 hours during the first night in the hospital with aid of medication and nursing interventions.
Intervention

Continue to direct patient to areas of minimal activity.
When possible, try to direct energy into productive and calming activities (e.g., slow, soft music; slow exercise; drawing alone; or writing in quiet area).
Encourage short rest periods throughout the day (e.g., 3 to 5 minutes every hour) when possible.
Patient should drink decaffeinated drinks only—decaffeinated coffee, tea, or colas.
Provide nursing measures at bedtime that promote sleep: warm milk, soft music.
Consider home environment consult to assess whether patient's home is safe and whether she can stay in home alone.

Rationale

Lower levels of stimulation can decrease excitability.
Directing patient to paced, non-stimulating activities can help minimize excitability.
Patient may be unaware of feelings of fatigue. Can collapse from exhaustion if hyperactivity continues without periods of rest.
Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that inhibits needed rest or sleep.
Such measures promote non-stimulating and relaxing mood.
Patient may not be able to return to home while rapist is at large. Family needs to look at support options of home safety.

Evaluation
GOAL MET

Sleeps for 2 hours from 7 to 9 pm and rested again from 2 am until 6:30 am.
Patient able to report feeling rested for the ""first time in weeks."" She was observed having short periods of uninterrupted calm throughout shift.
Patient agrees to stay with daughter for undetermined time while rapist is still ""at large.""

Short-Term Goal
Patient's blood pressure (BP) and pulse will be within normal limits within 24 hours with the aid of medication and nursing interventions.
Intervention

Continue to monitor BP and pulse frequently throughout the day (every 30 minutes).
Keep staff informed by verbal and written reports of baseline vital signs and patient progress.

Rationale

Anxious/panic and sleep-deprived condition could place an additional strain on patient's heart.
Alerting all staff regarding patient's status can increase medical intervention if a change in status occurs.

Evaluation
GOAL MET

Information from family physician states that baseline BP is 130/90 mm Hg and baseline pulse is 88 beats/min.
BP at end of first shift (8 hr) is 130/70 mm Hg and pulse is 78 beats/min.

Evaluation
At the time of her discharge from the 23-hour admission stabilization unit, the treatment team believed Ms. Blessing's mental and physical status was more stable. Her vital signs were within normal limits, she rested, she consumed sufficient food and fluids, and her urinary output and glucose level were normal. She openly expresses some reluctance to discharge to her own home, so in the discharge family session, it was agreed that she would stay with her daughter and family for an undetermined time to receive more support for stabilization. Ms. Blessing's insomnia and anxiety will continue to be a clinical treatment challenge; however, she seems motivated to participate in recommended aftercare outpatient therapy sessions that will include medication monitoring checks to adjusting medication as needed.
Both Ms. Blessing and her daughter were encouraged to continue with skills learned in the hospital and to keep and maintain follow-up care as directed. They were encouraged to report any untoward medication effects to the physician as soon as possible and follow up with her PCP within 2 days of release. They were further encouraged to contact a victim support group, which may offer peer support and interface efforts with police, which could serve to reduce Ms. Blessing's fear of revictimization.
Questions

This case study skips over Ms. Blessing's current diagnosis. Identify two key diagnoses you predict this included and why.
Ms. Blessing's outcomes, plan, and treatment seem to have been on point. During assessment, what did Nurse Juarez most likely have identified as objective data to support this diagnosis?
Identify at least three subjective data for Ms. Blessing.

Interview and Interdisciplinary Issue Identification,"Create a 2-4 page report on an interview you have conducted with a health care professional colleague. You will identify an issue from the interview that could be improved with an interdisciplinary approach, and review best practices and evidence to address the issue. This is the first of three assessments that build on each other.
By interviewing a healthcare colleague of your choice, you will begin to gather information about an interprofessional collaboration problem that your colleague is experiencing, or has experienced, in the workplace. You will identify a change theory and leadership strategies that can be applied to address this problemFor this assessment, you will report on the information gathered during your interview. You will discuss the interview strategy that you used to collect information. Your interview strategy should be supported by citations from the literature. The goal of this assessment is to analyze the interview data and identify an issue that would benefit from an interdisciplinary solution. This could be an issue that has not been addressed by an interdisciplinary approach or one that could benefit from improvements related to the interdisciplinary approach currently in use. Additionally, you will prepare for your Interdisciplinary Plan Proposal assessment by researching change theories, leadership strategies, and collaboration approaches that could be relevant to issue you have identified. Please be certain to review the scoring guide to confirm specific required elements of this assessment. Note that there are differences between basic, proficient and distinguished criteria.
Use the Interview and Issue Identification Template [DOCX] to help you stay organized and concise. As you complete the template, make sure you use APA format for in-text citations for the evidence and best practices that are informing your plan, as well as for the reference list at the end. (Because you're using a template, a title page is optional.)
Additionally, be sure to address the following criteria. Please study the scoring guide carefully so you know what is needed for a distinguished score.

Summarize an interview focused on past or current issues at a healthcare organization.
Identify an issue from an interview for which an evidence-based interdisciplinary approach would be appropriate.
Describe change theories and a leadership strategy that could help in developing an interdisciplinary solution to an organizational issue.
Describe collaboration approaches from the literature that could be relevant in establishing or improving an interdisciplinary team to address an organizational issue.
Organize content so ideas flow logically with smooth transitions; contains few errors in grammar/punctuation, word choice, and spelling.
Apply APA formatting to in-text citations and references exhibiting nearly flawless adherence to APA format.

\ 
The Evolution of Nursing Science and Practice: Historical Opportunities and Challenges Many historical challenges have influenced the evolution of nursing science and practice related to society, academic legitimacy and professional boundaries. One of the most significant challenges was establishing nursing as its own science, rather than simply an extension of medicine. Doubt about the independence as an academic and scientific field presided in the nursing field until recently, given that the knowledge of this professional discipline was historically considered to have been borrowed from other disciplines and fields, specifically from the biomedical and social sciences. The positivist influence was prevalent in the mid-20th century, where the emphasis on theory development and empirical validation bred a rigid ""hard science"" perspective along a continuum of the optimization of society through the provision of services, where humanistic and social aspects of nursing practice were diminished (Da Silva & Wynn, 2025). This caused a tension between the desirable standardization of scientific method used to deliver care and the holistic, individualized care which is the essence of nursing.
Furthermore, highlighting the relevance of feminist theory to nursing science is crucial, since it matched the core values of nursing science which consisted of advocacy, care, and social justice. But, feminist-driven changes encountered political and gender biases and were resisted, which further delayed the full recognition of nursing as a legitimate science (Mendívil, Choperena, & Salas, 2025). This was further compounded by the postmodern turn in nursing theory that criticized traditional paradigms and encouraged qualitative research and patient-centered narratives, which some scholars and critics believed lacked the scientific basis. This has long been one of the major divides in nursing  between those favoring the production of objective knowledge and those calling for a more subjective epistemology and continues to be a key challenge to the discipline.
The other fundamental problem towards transform of nursing practice has been the restriction of independency and acknowledgement of nurse practitioners in the healthcare setups. Nursing used to be considered a step down from medicine, with nurses as caretakers under the orders of physicians, not independent practitioners. This limited their participation in the formation of healthcare policy and evidence-based practices specific to concerns important in nursing. The emergence of advanced practice nursing and higher education for nurses, especially the DNP, has improved the role of nurses as innovators in healthcare, but we still have a significant pathway to go when it comes to fully realize this potential. According to Finnegan et al. (2025, p.), it’s hard to align nursing competencies, education standards, and degrees, varied across institutions, and resisted by traditional medical hierarchies.
Evidence-based practice (Essential III) and healthcare policy and advocacy (Essential V), identified as critical areas within DNP Essentials, are key requirements in overcoming previous obstacles that have historically limited the independence of the nursing profession and the development of nursing practice. Nevertheless, integrating these competencies holistically still mandates advocacy, legislation, and cross-disciplinary efforts to disrupt systemic obstacles. The future must distill this social science knowledge and marry it with nursing science and practice while contextualizing both from a philosophical view while reinforcing the methodology of research and redefining the nurse as both scientist and practitioner.

Hello Students,
A critical issue that continues to shape nursing evolution is the ongoing shortage of nurses and its impact on patient care. Historically, war and pandemics have highlighted the demand for skilled nurses, yet healthcare systems often struggle to maintain adequate staffing levels. In the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that by 2030, there will be a shortage of over 500,000 registered nurses, further exacerbated by high burnout rates (BLS, 2023). Given this trend, how do you think nursing education and policy should adapt to ensure that future nurses are well-equipped to handle workforce shortages while maintaining quality care?
Your insights into these historical challenges provide a strong foundation for understanding nursing’s growth, but it is also essential to consider how these past barriers inform current and future advancements in the profession.

Motivation is defined as a “condition—usually an internal one—that initiates, activates, or maintains” a
person’s behavior (Shiraev & Levy, 2021). In other words, it is a reason for doing something or working
toward a goal. What motivates you? Pause to consider that question as it is key to this Assignment. For
example, are you driven by the need for security, duty, recognition, self-actualization, or something else?
Your answer probably depends on the context in life (e.g., school, work, health, family) in question.
Various motivational theories can be applied in all of these contexts.

Now consider the influence culture has on shaping motivations within you. Most likely from your life
experiences, you are already aware that what motivates you may not be the same as what motivates
someone else, especially someone from a different cultural background. Emphasis placed on individual
achievement differs among cultures, as does tendency toward collective responsibility, consumerism,
spontaneity, and other factors related to motivation.

As you develop your understanding of motivation and view of achievement within cross-cultural
psychology, you will also continue to work on your scholarly writing skills. Your opinions in this
Assignment should be supported by evidence from the Learning Resources. Each time you mention an
idea from a resource, you should provide a citation (e.g., Author, Date) and include the full APA reference
in your reference list.

Part 2: Write a two-page reflection

Reflect on the leadership styles you’ve observed in others, as well as an interprofessional collaboration experience from your personal practice. What did or would effective leadership look like? What did or would effective collaboration look like? 
Be sure that your assessment addresses the following criteria. 
· Reflect on an interdisciplinary collaboration experience, noting ways in which it was successful and unsuccessful in achieving desired outcomes, and how effective leadership, or a lack of it, played a role. 
· A simplified gap-analysis approach may be useful:
· What happened?
· What went well?
· What did not go well?
· What should have happened?
· Compare and contrast effective leadership with ineffective leadership. What have you observed in others that works or doesn’t work when it comes to leadership?
· Given what you’ve shared about effective leadership and also what effective collaboration looks like, identify best-practice leadership strategies from the literature that would improve an interdisciplinary team’s ability to achieve its goals, citing at least one article from the literature.
· Also identify best-practice interdisciplinary collaboration strategies from the literature that would improve an interdisciplinary team’s ability to achieve its goals, citing at least one article from the literature.
· What leadership style do you think you need to develop more to support the above best-practice strategies you’ve described? How would you do that?
· Include a full reference list from relevant and evidence-based (published within 5 years) sources, adhering to APA format.
You will also be required to submit an APA-formatted reference list for any sources that you cited or used to inform your reflection.



·

Rough Draft 

My aspiration to become a social worker is deeply rooted in my professional experiences and the insights I’ve gained about the challenges faced by vulnerable populations. During my internship at the VA hospital, where I handled patient records, I often engaged with my supervisors about the difficulties veterans encounter upon returning home. Many veterans face issues such as homelessness, mental health struggles, and suicidal ideation. This exposure highlighted the urgent need for effective advocacy and support systems for those who have served our country, inspiring my desire to pursue a Master’s in Social Work to advocate for veterans specifically. One personal connection that drives this ambition is my cousin, an immigrant from Haiti who served six years in the U.S. Army. Despite her hopes for stability through military service, she now struggles to make ends meet, exemplifying the obstacles many veterans grapple with after service.

Additionally, my current role as a claims adjuster at Progressive has further shaped my understanding of the emotional and psychological challenges individuals face after car accidents. I assist clients in navigating the aftermath of their traumatic experiences, often witnessing their feelings of helplessness and confusion. This experience has solidified my commitment to providing compassionate support and effective resources to help individuals regain a sense of normalcy in their lives. It motivates me to further develop my skills as a social worker, emphasizing the vital role that advocacy plays in transforming the lives of those who encounter significant disruptions.

Howard University’s MSW program is my first choice because of its commitment to social justice and its Black perspective, which aligns perfectly with my mission to advocate for marginalized communities, particularly within the veteran population. I recognize the systemic barriers that my community and veterans face, and I am dedicated to addressing these challenges head-on. In Florida, where I currently reside, licensure requires 1-2 years of supervised clinical experience and passing the National Social Work Licensing Exam from the Association of Social Work Boards (ASWB). Similarly, I know that Maryland, where I plan to relocate, has equivalent licensure requirements, compelling me to obtain a degree from an accredited program like that offered by Howard University.

Time management has been crucial in my academic and professional journey. While pursuing my undergraduate degree, I maintained a meticulous schedule that included class times, deadlines, work commitments, and relaxation periods, ensuring I balanced my responsibilities effectively. This strategy will serve me well in Howard University’s online MSW program, enabling me to engage fully with my studies and practice.

The National Association of Social Workers’ Code of Ethics serves as an essential guideline in my professional conduct, emphasizing integrity, social justice, and respect for every individual’s dignity and worth. I aspire to embody these principles in my practice, being a strong advocate for my clients and promoting equitable treatment for those in need.

Technology plays an integral role in today’s academic and professional landscapes. While platforms like LinkedIn facilitate networking and provide access to opportunities, I recognize the limitations of relying solely on technology. My professors instilled the importance of mastering foundational processes, encouraging me to engage in traditional networking while also utilizing technology for efficiency. By striking this balance, I aim to foster meaningful connections within the social work field.

Through these experiences and insights, I am committed to addressing the unique challenges facing both veterans and marginalized communities. With Howard University’s esteemed MSW program, I am determined to translate my aspirations into tangible change, contributing to a more equitable society where all individuals, particularly veterans, have the support they need to succeed.",Psychology,Social|Psyc ,https://www.sweetstudy.com/questions/personal-statement-20889455

Value of Instruction

As a teacher, I frequently discuss the different parts of speech with my students. For this 
assignment, I created an instructional video teaching students three different verb types. I 
decided to focus on helping, linking, and action verbs because my intended audience is 
elementary students, specifically second and third graders. This video will be a valuable resource
because I can play it for my students next year during grammar lessons. I can show the video to 
my student at the beginning of the year, and I can leave it in an additional resource module for 
them to refer to throughout the year in case they need to refresh their memories.  

Focus and Audience

My video is intended for students in elementary schools. Specifically, second and third grades to 
align with early education grammar standards. North Carolina Common Core Standards state the 
second and third graders should be able to explain the function of verbs, and form and use simple
tenses. The exact North Carolina Common Core Standards are:

1. L.2.2 Demonstrate command of the conventions of standard English capitalization, punctuation, 
and spelling when writing; demonstrate proficiency within the 2-3 conventions continuum. (See 
Language Standards – Conventions Continuum page 10.) 

2. L.3.2 Demonstrate command of the conventions of standard English capitalization, punctuation, 
and spelling when writing; demonstrate proficiency within the 2-3 conventions continuum. (See 
Language Standards – Conventions Continuum page 11.) 

Engagement

I tried to include different layers so that my video did not look like a plan PowerPoint. I added 
videos of my children demonstrating action verbs to give viewers an image to go with the lesson.
There is animation during transitions between the information to add a bit of creativity. 

Explanation

As a teacher, I use the first 10-15 minutes of the ELA block to teach different aspects of 
grammar. This video will work perfectly as a quick introduction to helping, linking, and action 
verbs. I can play this at the start of class, pausing one time for the class to work on a sample 
sentence together. I can then pause it again to allow my students time to work on the last 
sentence independently for one minute. After the minute has passed, I can resume the video so 
my students can see if the identified the verb and named it correctly.

To create my video, I used my cell phone and laptop. I used my cellphone to capture the videos 
and the audio presented in my video. I used my laptop to download an app named Cap Cut. 
When I began my project, I was totally lost and did not know where to start. My niece, who is 
attempting to be a YouTuber, told me to download Cap Cut and told me how to use it. After 
mapping out my video, I record the video clips of my children and I on my cellphone. Then, I 
picked a template on Cap Cut and put the information slides together. Lastly, I uploaded my 
video clips and audio to Cap Cut and edited the video to make it look like one. The entire thing 
was confusing at first, but I plan to repeat these steps at least three more times before the end of 
the year, for content other content that I will be teaching my students to practice making videos.

INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO PROJECT ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS 

OVERVIEW 

The flexibility of video allows compression and expansion of time and space, making it a 
powerful instructional tool. An instructional video should address 3 to 5 specific learning objects 
for a specific audience of learners. The video you plan and create must be instructional in nature 
and work to form associations between concepts, provide historical or social examples, or 
demonstrate how something works.  

INSTRUCTIONS 

For this assignment, you will capture a minimum of three separate video segments using an 
actual video camera (a screen capture of your computer screen will not suffice) and edit these to 
produce a quality instructional video with a length of between four and six minutes. Make it fun 
and informative to engage your learners.  

The mark of a good video is the ability to take a person who has very little experience or 
understanding of a concept and help them reach the learning objectives identified, which might 
include accomplishing a task. If you purchase the game Throw Throw Burrito TM, the instructions 
within the box invite the players to grab their phones and pull up the YouTube video to see how 
to play. You can view that Watch: Throw Throw Burrito – How to Play video in this 
module’s Learn section. During this short 4:41-minute presentation, the audience learns how to 
play and the rules surrounding the game. Sure, the players could have read the PDF instructions, 
but the video engages the audience and teaches the skills necessary to play the game. 

Also included in your course resources for this module are several other examples of 
instructional videos. Notice in Watch: Introduction to Significant Figures how Joelle Acre 
suspended the camera above her workspace for the instruction on significant figures. Notice, too, 
how she splices in video clips of herself that add engagement value. Katie Meert created her 
instructional video (Watch: Common and Proper Nouns) to teach her third graders about 
common and proper nouns. She uses music during some of the demonstration of examples but 
leaves the music off during the initial practice time picking it up again as student confidence 
builds through practice. Please note that, in each of the examples, points may have been lost 
based on missing components identified on the rubric for this assignment. 

Once your video is complete, you will upload it to Canvas via Kaltura and along with the 
Instructional Video Project Template, where you will describe various elements of your video. 

The following section provides tips and additional information for the project. 

 




           EDUC 730 

Page 2 of 5 
 

Planning the video 

1. Have an idea. This is important. A good idea is fairly easy to implement and follow. 
WRITE IT DOWN.  

2. Refer to the rubric for this assignment often. Your video needs to be between 4 and 6 
minutes long.  

3. Have a plan. The better you plan, the less time the whole project will take. This is true in 
life in general but it is doubly so in video editing. Storyboard out your idea. Figure out 
what shots you’ll need and what environment the shots should be in. Iterate! 

a. Do you need any special props or extra hands or expertise to help out? 
b. Do you need to use a “green screen or green wall” to achieve the effect that 

you want? 
c. Do you have a preset idea of what you want to say, or are you just filming 

something that is happening spontaneously? 
d. What are you going to wear?  
e. How much time will it take to film? It will take longer than you think; allow 

for it. 
f. Will you need special sound effects? If so, what are they, and where will you 

get them? 

4. Write a “script” that you can follow to ensure you don’t forget anything. This way, you 
can also take a couple of takes in case something goes wrong. 

5. If you plan on using music, think about using it carefully. If it is important to the film, it 
is important to keep it in mind from the start. Music is very powerful: use it wisely. Don’t 
use music for the entire length of the video. If you desire, do use it to create interest at the 
beginning, middle, or end. Overuse can be distracting to the learner. 

6. If you are going to use the microphone directly from the camera or video recorder, make 
sure that the camera is picking it up well enough. You might need a mic or some other 
plan of attack. Place the mic close to the subject and point it away from (undesired) noise. 
Sound is often more important than visuals or pictures. 

7. **Always take more film at the beginning and end of every take than you need. It will 
make editing easier. Give yourself a little extra recorded content to play with. 

8. Once you have written a great plan and implemented it, you will likely have unedited 
video segments with much more footage and content than you’ll actually need. 




           EDUC 730 

Page 3 of 5 
 

Implementing the Plan 

1. When videoing, use a tripod whenever possible. 

2. Avoid frequent panning and zooming – it can cause visual distress. 

3. Balanced lighting is important. Create a good contrast between the subject and the 
background. Be conscious of light sources and shadows on your subject. 

4. Get as close as possible to your subject—this heightens impact and improves audio. You 
might also ask your actors to speak up! 

5. Follow the rule of thirds, frame off-center 

6. Record a few seconds before a scene starts and after it ends – this provides you with 
footage to make transitions. 

7. Be sure that the date and time are set on the camera, that NightShot is turned off, and that 
all video is shot in the same aspect ratio (i.e., either 16:9 widescreen or 4:3 traditional 
broadcast). 

8. Follow your curiosity on the day of your shoot. Overshoot! Get more than you think you 
need! More stuff gives you more options when editing, and longer takes allow you some 
wiggle room for transitions. 

Editing the video 

1. Make sure you set aside a large block of time for video editing. **Video editing is not a 
fast process! 

2. Title/Opening and Closing Credits are essential. 

3. When capturing video to the computer, be sure that the capture format is set to “DV full 
quality.” Then click on Settings, and in the Capture Source tab, set scene detection to 
“automatic based on shooting time and date.” “Automatic based on scene content” is the 
second-best choice if the “time and date” option does not detect scenes. 

4. Make a rough cut of the whole film then go into details. Iterate. Cut early: when in doubt, 
edit shorter cuts. Also, choose a style that works with quick cuts- don’t get swallowed up 
by the mechanics. 




           EDUC 730 

Page 4 of 5 
 

5. When editing, use the Save As command frequently and save your project with a 
different name (e.g., add an incremental number to the end of the name). This can be a 
lifesaver if you need to go back to a previous edition of the project or if the software 
should experience an anomaly. 

6. If any scenes are too light or too dark, you can use Auto Color Correct and then move the 
brightness slider as needed. Note that this will adjust the brightness of the entire clip. 

7. Keep it simple; avoid superfluous animated transitions, and shorter is almost always 
better. Also, keep a critical eye. 

Create your instructional video using several of the following types of technologies: 

● Live Action Video using an actual video camera (avoid using your cell phone 
unless this is the only recording tool you have available. If the cellphone is used, 
you must hold the phone horizontally and not vertically to capture the recording. 
This will better allow for a 16 by 9 ratio). 

● You should piece together a minimum of three video segments using editing 
software such as Movavi, iMovie, WeVideo, or Adobe Premier. 

● In order to submit your assignment, you will upload your video via Kaltura using 
a textbox submission entry. Please follow the steps within the How to Submit a 
Video Presentaiton document found within the assignment resources section for 
instructions on how to embed your video into a textbook submission entry.  

For the final product, make sure that: 

● Video footage was taken with an actual handheld video camera 

● Video is between 4–6 minutes 

● Video is uploaded to the Canvas text box submission entry via Kaltura, and the 
template is also submitted. In order to submit the template, you must use the 
“Documents” tab within the text box submission and click “Upload Documents.” 
This will allow you to upload the template document below the embeded video. 

● Video is edited and rendered in widescreen (16:9 ratio) 

● Video contains the required screens 

○ Title Slide/Screen 




           EDUC 730 

Page 5 of 5 
 

○ List of objectives, steps, or instructions 

○ Credits slide-cite all sources and contributors 

● Video has smooth transitions (rather than harsh cuts) and sounds are well-
balanced 

● Video includes at least two transitions, such as: 

o   Cut Dissolve 

o   Wipe 

o   Fade 

● The video includes 3 types of shots 

o   Wide-Long 

o   Medium 

o   Close 

● At least three separately recorded segments are combined into one video. 

● Video editing software was used, adding value.

Final Poster 

Guidelines 
  Untitled document 

Final Poster Guidelines 
The following guidelines are prepared for preparation of the final poster. 

Poster Format 
You do not need to submit a hardcopy. I need a digital file. Please send your poster in a 
readable digital format such as Powerpoint or PDF. The digital file should resemble an 
academic poster board such as the ones that you can find in the many samples online 
or the one I posted. It can be a large resolution file, I can zoom through the different 
areas. While you can use PowerPoint as your canvas, do not turn in a slideshow.  

I strongly recommend you visit this very comprehensive poster resource page: 
http://gradschool.unc.edu/student/postertips.html. 

Links to an external site. 

Google ""academic posters"" and you will get many results. If you click ""images"" you will 
see many examples.  


http://gradschool.unc.edu/student/postertips.html


http://gradschool.unc.edu/student/postertips.html




You can find advice on design and links to templates. Please make sure to go 
over all information on academic posters on this website. It will make your work a 
lot easier and most likely a lot better. 

Please do not think of the poster as the ""easy way out"" instead of a term paper. You will 
need to provide depth, theory, academic sources, etc. just like in a termpaper. Your 
presentation will rely more on visual aid. You will need to demonstrate that you are 
mastering the topic you chose. Be analytical and clear! 

Overall be creative. In a poster you need to present the same amount of information 
from a paper in a different way. Tables, diagrams, pictures, illustrations can replace text. 
Short paragraphs are fine, some bullet point lists are fine, but make sure to really make 
the visuals work. In other words, don't write an abbreviated termpaper and copy and 
paste it onto a poster board. Images should add to the analysis, not just add decorative 
elements - I often see the scale of justice, hands shacking, an image of the declaration 
of independence, etc. those images don't add anything. 

For example if there are relationships between conflicting parties, then you might outline 
those by using arrows and explaining the relationships on the arrows. If there is conflict 
that entails geographic aspects, a map helps, etc. Conflict timelines are very useful. 

Possible Outline Poster 
1)     Introduction 

● Purpose of the poster 
● How information was gathered 

2)     Theory 

● A lens from which to view an event 
● Presentation of one theory from the Intro to CR Psychology course 
● How does the theory explain the phenomena of this conflict 
● References to readings and other sources 

3)     Social context 

● Background of conflict - there is no social vacuum 
● Historical 
● Environment of the conflict 
● Culture 

4)     Analysis/Main part 




● SPITCEROW or other analytical framework (does theory impact the analysis) 
OR how does the theory explain a conflict situation (e.g. structural violence 
and native Americans) 

● Be very specific - that's the whole idea of conflict mapping. For the parties, be 
careful with broad generalizations like ""middle class"" vs. impoverished 
classes. Try working with the actual conflicting parties rather than with 
""scientific community"", ""nonprofits"". In an conflict analysis case study you 
want to work with specifics. 

5)     Summary and conclusion 

● Summary: what was the purpose, framework, social context, findings 
● Conclusion: Statement that reveals the understanding of how to analyze 

conflict and integrate course material regarding constructive conflict 
transformation. 

6)     Bibliography 

● APA style (it is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with APA style) or 
other accepted format (e.g. Chicago Style, MLA) 

● Some academic sources in addition to non-academic information 
● Primary sources: newspapers, reports, court cases, interviews, documentary, 

films 
● Secondary sources: books, essays, journals 

On Academic Sources 
On this poster you are required to cite academic sources.  See the lecture notes and the 
recommended readings on the syllabus, there are a lot of references. You can and 
should use those readings to frame your poster. They are not related to your topic but 
provide some general information on social conflict, why it should be studied and how it 
is studied. 

Obviously more academic sources are perfectly acceptable and will most likely improve 
your overall strength of the poster. Look at the recommended readings on the syllabus, 
they should help you. Also, when you read scholarly articles, you can get a nice idea 
how to work with other sources. You see how authors use the ideas of others in their 
work.   

Your academic sources for the poster do not necessarily have to relate to the conflict as 
such. It is more likely that you will use them for your theoretical framework. See my 
example at the bottom where I connected an urban conflict scenario with two theories. 




Consult with me if you have difficulties. Do it early, I will not be able to help you out last 
minute when you decide you help with your poster. 

Your academic sources will either be academic books or journal articles that you find at 
the library or in the online databases. Websites as academic sources are not acceptable 
(articles that you retrieve via the PSU databases online are perfectly fine; usually they 
are PDF files of the printed journal). You must not use Wikipedia as a source in any 
academic paper or poster. 

In your analysis (SPITCEROW or other analytical framework) you most likely will have 
to resort to non-academic sources (newspaper archives, news magazines, credible 
websites, etc.). That is fine. Theory, however, cannot be approached that way. When 
you frame your conflict you might come across numbers and facts. Be careful with that. 
A fact for one person/group might not be the same fact for another one. If you use 
“facts”, make sure you state “according to…” (or something similar). Be critical, only 
because it is written down somewhere, it is not necessarily good/correct/true/… 

Make sure to cite all ideas that are not your own. If you write down the work of someone 
else without indicating you did so, that is called plagiarism. We are here in this class to 
learn together. Nobody will be punished for mistakes or problems with interpreting the 
work of others. Plagiarism, however, is unacceptable. 

Connecting theory to a case 
analysis 
How do we start? We just need to go back to the meaning of ‘theory’. In its most basic 
form, a theory should explain a phenomenon. In other words, it should explain why 
something happens the way it does. When we look at a form or specific case of conflict 
we need to think about an explanation. 

Let’s look at an example to see how we can connect a case to a theoretical 
explanation. 

 A recurring phenomenon of social conflict is that of collective urban violence. Collective 
urban violence is a phenomenon known to humanity since ancient times. The Nika 
revolt of the year 532 in Constantinople (today’s city of Istanbul in Turkey) was one of 
the earliest documented urban riots in history. Throughout the centuries, and especially 
in the Twentieth Century, urban areas have been affected by innumerous uprisings. 




 During the fall of 2005, urban riots were once again brought into the international 
spotlight. This time the city of Paris was struck - not for the first time – by violent civic 
unrest. As many other riots, they took place in specific social surroundings. Similar to 
the 1992 riots in Los Angeles, which hit the very poor neighborhood of South Central 
L.A rather than the prosperous area of Beverly Hills, the Paris riots took place in the so 
called banlieues. 

The social situation in these French suburbs is complex, but basically the roots of these 
riots can be traced back to the perceived inequality of the have-nots with respect to the 
haves. We are looking at societies with dominant cultures, each wishing to maintain the 
status quo. The racial inequalities reflect to some degree the racial/ethnic differences 
existing throughout France in general, where tensions exist between the dominantly 
white, Christian, French society and mainly Muslim immigrants of African origin. The 
historical aspects, with which we are dealing, have their roots in the complex 
development of contemporary French urban society. 

Two main theoretical concepts, namely relative deprivation and collective violence, can 
be used to explain the conflict(s). Relative Deprivation is defined as a perceived 
discrepancy between people’s value expectations and their value capabilities (Gurr, 
1970). Collective violence causes immediate physical damage, is committed by two or 
more participants and has at least partly coordination among perpetrators (Tilly, 2003). 

So what does that mean in the situation urban riots in France? 

The eruption of violence in France can be considered as the expression of long 
accumulated anger, which can be attributed to experienced relative deprivation in young 
people – a deprivation of participation in society. Ongoing social deprivation, 
manifesting itself in both overt and covert factors such as poverty, racism, mass 
unemployment, uncertain identity, and dim prospects for the future has contributed to 
the accumulation of this anger. Although officially given the French nationality, these 
young people have been integrated into the French society only on a bureaucratic level. 
Along with this pseudo-integration, the value expectations of these youths adapt to the 
values inherent to the French society; however, the future value potential provided to 
them within the society remains very low. Amidst limited societal opportunities many of 
these individuals perceive themselves to be in a situation of deprivation, particularly 
exhibiting the pattern of aspirational deprivation developed by Gurr (1970). 

The French riots can clearly be interpreted in terms of Tilly’s (2003) theory of collective 
violence, given the fact that the rioting groups were made up of numerous participants – 
partly acting as gangs - and that they were coordinated to a certain extent in their 
actions against police forces. 

 




Let’s stop here for now and break it down again. 

 The conflict: 

● Urban riots in France 

 Theoretical concepts: 

● Collective Violence 
● Relative Deprivation 

 We cannot come up with complete list of theoretical concepts related to social conflict. 
However, in order to be able to think about the conflicts we are examining in this course, 
here are some of the more prevalent ones: 

 Selected theoretical approaches toward understanding social conflict: 

Globalization 

● Collective Violence 
● Power 
● Human Needs 
● Identity 
● Belonging 
● Resources 
● Environment 
● Prejudice 
● Worldviews 
● Assimilation 
● Structural Violence 
● Competition 
● Social Control 

... 

You can find theorists on all those concepts by searching academic literature. Let’s take 
look at structural violence, a concept which we discussed quite extensively: 

""According to Galtung (1969), structural violence is the ongoing and institutionalized 
harm done to individuals by preventing them from meeting their basic needs for survival, 
well-being, identity and freedom. Structural violence is embedded into the structures of 
social order and the institutional arrangements of power on a constant basis (Barak, 
2003). As aptly defined by Bornstein “structural violence is built into everyday life, into 
the economy, a political system, and into the landscape” (2002, p. 6). We might also talk 
about ‘symbolic’ or ‘soft’ violence."" 




 This conceptualization then will allow you to connect it to cases of social conflict. 
Essentially that’s it. You look at a conflict case, you find a theory to explain the 
phenomenon and you analyze it 

 Other Advice 

● Look at journal articles and see how they are written. 
● Be very tedious in checking for spelling and grammatical errors; with today’s 

word processing programs typos and grammatical errors can be avoided. 
Your posters will be marked down for avoidable errors. 

● Familiarize yourself with APA (http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/section/2/10/) 
● Links to an external site. 
●  or MLA (http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/) 
● Links to an external site. 
●  style of format for your writing and citing. This is expected and will not be 

covered in the course. All writing must be submitted by consistently following 
one of the format and citation styles. Your posters will be marked down if 
you do not follow the format guidelines with respect to correct citations. 

● There is a reason why I added a list of “recommended readings” – they are 
helpful for your poster. 

● A trip to the library and/or being familiar with the online databases is 
inevitable for the successful completion of the poster. 

● Have someone proof-read your work before you submit it 
● Don’t wait until the last minute

Complex Negotiation Activity,"In the past weeks, the discussion question has asked you to reflect on your negotiation history and engage the forum with an example from your past. This week, you are asked to engage in a new negotiation event and utilize your growing skill set. In other words, negotiate the purchase of something, the restaurant for dinner, time off at work, household chores with your children, or any other situation that works well for you and that you can complete in the first part of the week (before the initial post is due). Of course, the earlier in the week you start, the better prepared you can be for the negotiation. Whatever negotiation you try, challenge yourself. Make it something both meaningful and worthwhile for strategic negotiation.

For the first paragraph of your initial post, describe the negotiation event that you are using for this week's discussion, including the participants, the key issues, and the outcome.
For the second part of your initial post, evaluate any one of the following starter bullet points, using research on course concepts to support your analysis:

 

Negotiations      most often occur between two people having a meaningful relationship, such      as spouses, coworkers, and suppliers and customers. Therefore,      relationships tend to influence present and future interactions, however      cordial or adversarial they might be. The dynamics of a relationship and      its importance to each party also affect the strategies used and the      outcomes reached in a negotiation. How did the relationship impact the      negotiation event? How did it influence your preparation, your choice of      strategy, and the outcome?


 
Relationship      is only one type of interest that might surface in a negotiation. Our      course material also notes that substantive and process interests affect      negotiations. Evaluate the various types of interests that existed in the      negotiation (could be expressed or implied interests). How did those      interests contribute to the outcome?


 
Present      negotiations often set precedents for future negotiations. Evaluate the      influence your negotiation might have on future negotiations with the same      party and different parties. Explain what precedent has been set for the      process, for the relationship, and for the styles and strategies.


 
Reputation,      trust, and fairness are the key considerations in a negotiation when a      long-term relationship is at stake. How did reputation, trust, and justice      or fairness impact the way you negotiated with that person? If the      relationship was already strong, how did the negotiation further enhance the      relationship? If the relationship was not a good one, how might the way      you negotiated repair or further harm it?


 
Coalitions      preserve or increase an individual's resources. There is, typically, a      gain in leverage, power, or resources or the likelihood of reaching a goal      when forces are joined. Examples of coalitions include political      alliances, two children agreeing to work together to gain parental      permission, and a buying group in a professional association where the      higher number of members can get added member discounts. What coalitions      were present in your negotiation? If a coalition was not present, what      coalition might have been possible to create greater advantage? Evaluate      whether the coalition (present or possible) is likely to be long term or      short term. How could the coalition be broken, and what would be the      effect on the negotiation?


 
Negotiations      can sometimes include multiple parties. For instance, in addition to a      buyer and a seller, a real estate transaction may include a real estate broker,      a financial source, an insurance agent, a surveyor, and property      inspectors. What multiple parties were evident in your negotiation?      Describe what challenges were presented by the increased number of      negotiators in your multiparty negotiation. How did having multiple      parties influence the outcome?

Required text book

Rothman, J. C. (2011). From the front lines: Student cases in social work ethics. Boston: Allyn & Bacon. 
                            

(please let me know if you can access this book)




The purpose of this assignment is your you to carefully think about and write about the ethical considerations of a specific case (or cases), as well as to put yourself in the position of a social worker/counselor providing direct services to the clients/families in the case.
This assignment requires you to pull from your previous readings in our class so far (including textbook and the NASW Code of Ethics). I am also requiring a choice of one additional reading on Process Recording in Social Work. (Attached). 
                            From the Front Lines book is needed (or a case from 
                            From the Front Lines).
                        

Part 1: Getting Started

1. Select a case from your casebook. (OK if you wish to select more than 1 case).
2. Select and carefully read 
                            one of the two attached articles on Process Recordings.
                        
3. Please answer these questions:
a. What case did you select and why? [1-2 paragraphs]
b. Summarize in your own words what the case is about. [1/2-1page]
c. What is an example of an ethical dilemma you are able to identify in the case? (in your own words, please be specific.) [1/2-1 page]
d. What feelings/reactions/questions came up for you after you read and thought about the case? [1/2 page]

Part 2: Imagine you are the social worker/counselor assigned to the case,
                        
a. Where would you start? [1-2 paragraphs]
b. Please identify 
                            three considerations that you would put in place to ensure that you are handling the case in an ethical way. (For example, confidentiality, conflict of interests…) (Please use your textbook, the casebook, and the NASW Code of Ethics) [2 paragraphs]
                        
 
c. Read Process Recording article.
d. Create a version of a Process Recording where you write down (word-for-word, as in a script) everything that happened in a session with the clients/family in the case. You also need to include our gut reactions and questions. (Please refer to the Process Recording article you selected) [1-2 pages]
 
This requires some creativity and imagination on your part. Think of

Kristen,
        
Referring to employees as human resources does place them on a level of being an investment for the future and not an expense in the present. This is seeing employees as contributing to long-term business success and not as expenditures. Organizations that invest in employees through training, professional development, and workplace involvement build a stronger and more dedicated workforce. As TriNet (2023) emphasizes, the HR role has an integral role in hiring and developing employees to support them to grow and develop within the organization. This ongoing investment in human capital drives productivity, retention, and overall organizational performance, making employees valuable assets and not expenditures. In judging the value of an employee of a company, tangible and intangible factors need to be considered. Employees contribute in the form of skill, creativity, and commitment to the goals of a company. Employees contribute to company culture, train new staff, and provide customer satisfaction. Leddy (2017) adds that employees are also responsible for making a company agile and profitable, making them all the more assets.
From a moral perspective, lowering workers to costs is forgetting that workers are responsible, moral beings who contribute immensely to an organization. Companies need to create a culture that respects employees more than quantifiable aspects. The Institute of Business Ethics (n.d.) recommends that companies focus on treating workers justly, being honest with them, and rewarding good deeds to maximize the morale and productivity of the workplace. Lastly, valuing human capital can support human dignity by valuing employees for their crucial role in making an organization thrive. Properly utilized, this practice aims at the valuing of human contribution over reducing them to financial considerations. Misused, however, it can contribute to exploitative business practices contrary to sound ethical business practice. Generally, organizations have to try and strike a balance between financial evaluation and regard for the well-being and contribution of workers.
Amber,
Labeling the employees as ""human resources"" can change business strategy by letting the companies view their people as long-term investments rather than becoming immediate costs. Once the companies look at the perspective, they become better placed to focus on employee development, which can improve retention and provide skills critical for company success (Henderson, 2023). This is because of growing perception among leaders that investing in growth forms not only closes critical talent gaps but also strengthens the future of the organization.
While largely considered an accounting expense, that is, salaries or benefits together with training costs, employees are also intangible assets because they bring creativity, problem-solving, and positive company culture that fuels innovation and customer satisfaction. Intangible contributions are more difficult to quantify but are critical to defining the real value of a company's workforce, giving businesses a more holistic view about assessing the impact of employees on more than just simple cost metrics. Ethical standpoint must be addressed. Companies give employees priority by valuing ""human capital,"" which risks the dehumanizing aspect when not handled sensibly. Companies can address this by showing proper respect and ethical care for employees. Some companies, for example, conduct regular sessions to check up on the well-being of their employees, thereby promoting work conditions (Meier, 2024). This is the equilibrium approach that gives employees individual importance while seeing the individual as a critical player in business success.",Human Resource Management,Solution,https://www.sweetstudy.com/questions/discussion-2-mr-20889553

Failure to adapt nutrition to our current specific life stage will generate severe health consequences. The nutritional demands differ across stages of life thus inadequate nutrition intake leads to health issues such as nutrient deficiencies weakened immunity and long-term diseases.
The growth and maturation process demands proper nourishment as young people go through their youth. People with low calcium and vitamin D levels develop weak bones which creates a higher possibility of developing osteoporosis during their older years. Adults who eat high amounts of processed foods containing excessive sugar combined with bad fats are at risk of developing obesity alongside diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
Nutrition stands as an essential factor for people who are pregnant. I know from being pregnant right now that proper amounts of folic acid, iron, and protein in my diet help the development of my baby during pregnancy. Neural tube defects and anemia will develop as complications when expecting mothers do not receive essential nutrients.
The natural aging process brings a reduced metabolic rate together with shrinking muscle mass thus making older adults require protein-rich and calorie-reduced diets. A failure to change nutritional habits will significantly increase the risks of becoming undernourished alongside physical weakness and diminished cognitive abilities. A successful transition through life requires proper nutritional adjustments for people to achieve long-term wellness. 

Discussion#2
As we change our body's change and go through different kinds of changes weather its pregnancy or changes in a human body so which comes to then nutritional needs will need to change as well. just like in the reading where the mother had to change her nutritional diet because of her expecting a baby. She not only had to meet the nutritional needs of herself but also had to meet the nutritional needs of her unborn child which means she had to change the way she ate because she was pregnant and wants a healthy baby. I know myself from experience had to also change my nutritional needs from when I was a child to becoming an adult because we don't need as much calories or nutrients when were young as we do an adult plus our taste buds also change I know it did for me certain foods I liked when I was young I find don't appeal to me as much anymore, while foods that I didn't like when I was younger I do like or don't mind eating them now.

Designing an Inclusive and Effective Assessment Plan for a Diverse Middle School 

Mathematics Class

School and Student Population Description

This assessment plan is relevant to a suburban-based middle school with a total student 

enrollment of 1200 students. The students are also diverse in terms of their socioeconomic and 

cultural backgrounds; 45% are Hispanic, 35% are white, 15% are Black, and less than 5% are 

Asian or belong to any other race. 12% of the students require special education services, and 

20% of them are enrolled with ELL (English as a second language) status (Appiah-Odame, 2). 

Some of the ways through which it ensures that it supports equality are by offering several 

resources and opportunities that will cater to both the academic and social aspects.

Thus, using diagnostic assessments, it was revealed that the students are deficient. in their 

abilities to apply the formal knowledge and skills to solve complex analytical as well as practical 

tasks. Also, the students are able to perform well in practical activities as well as teamwork. 

These strengths and challenges are incorporated into this assessment plan of equitably applying 

the skills in practical group activities with feedback systems (Dixson and Worrell, 3).

Promoting Learning and an Inclusive Environment

This assessment plan helps to create the inclusive learning environment in which all the 

students will be able to reach their potential through the variety of the assessment submission 

and getting through options provided in accordance with their learning styles. Through the 

incorporation of formative quizzes and project assignments, as well as peer and self-assessments, 

it is considered that all students have an equal chance to show mastery in different manners. 




3

Different students, especially the visual, auditory, and movers, require certain activities to learn 

most of what is taught in class.

In an assessment for learning context, students are grouped to be taught in different 

groups based on the results of formative assessment. Peer and self-assessment is beneficial to the 

social-emotional learning process since it brings out the issues of self-awareness, self-reflection, 

and responsibilities held by the classmates. Besides, this plan also stresses practicality, which 

enhances the understanding of concepts as well as the performance of those students who may 

experience difficulties with the theoretical part. These include the state’s pupil improvement 

plans and any long-term state plans that may impact education in order to increase effectiveness 

for ELL and special ed students (Angelo and Zakrajsek, 1).

Assessment Plan Overview

The system of seven-week grading periods is designed considering the important learning 

objectives; each week is dedicated to the growth of both the academic and the practical 

experience. The area of specialization is mathematics, and the plan complies with the CCSS and 

local learning objectives. The imposed Objectives therein include place value, pattern, and 

solving real-life problems.

General Learning Target

The main concept here is to achieve the improvement of students’ mathematical skills, 

their ability to reason and think critically, and to solve problems in teams. They are mastering 

place value, pattern usage, and generalization. These are the involvements of these concepts in 

handling budgets and other quantifiable data.

Timeframe and Objectives

Here below is the timetable set for the various objectives to be achieved in each. week.




4

Week 1-2: Understanding place value (CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.NBT.A.1)

Week 3-4: Recognizing and generating patterns (CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.OA.B.3)

Week 5-7: Integration—using the materials of the course and demonstrating 

mathematical concepts in the context of group tasks and projects on keeping and managing 

budgets.

Assessment Techniques

It consists of three major approaches to assessment that aim at evaluating as well as 

enhancing students’ learning. These motivate different intelligences. and come with provisions 

for practice and learning from one’s strengths and areas that require improvements.

1. Formative Quizzes

Description: Quizzes are short and not high-stakes quizzes, as they are meant to check 

the understanding of number kingdom concepts such as place value and pattern recognition.

Purpose: The primary intent of formative assessment is used to give an instant response 

that will help the teacher and students to determine strong points and the ones that a learner is 

lacking.

Student Activities: Students will be tested weekly and choose the type of questions, like 

multiple-choice or short answer, for the week’s lesson objectives.

Follow-Up: Teachers shall analyze the quiz. performance and conclude from it the areas 

of misunderstanding, specifically in JK, which needs to be redressed in the subsequent lessons.

Rationale: Evidence proves that such quizzes enhance recall and detection of knowledge 

gaps in a relaxed, non-high-stakes environment (Dixson and Worrell, 3).

Inclusion Strategies: Quizzes will come in different categories, where some will involve 

the use of diagrams and some will involve the use of number problems.




5

2. Project-Based Assessment

Description: As a part of team endeavors, students have to incorporate the concepts of 

mathematics to solve problems. For instance, the students will be expected to prepare a budget 

for a school program.

Purpose: To be able to demonstrate academic concepts and apply them to practice by 

solving problems, putting into consideration the elements of thinking critically, innovatively, and 

in groups.

Student Activities: Students will be placed in groups so they can design a project, 

estimate costs, and present the solutions to the class.

Follow-Up: Teachers will give the kind of feedback where they assign the rubric for 

creativity, accuracy, and especially for the problem-solving part. In this case, it will be the duty 

of the students. to use the feedback given to them by their instructors to make the necessary 

corrections to their work.

Rationale: This strategy will help to involve students because they can relate what they 

are taught in class to real-life issues. Contribution is also made to transferable skills like 

teamwork and finance skills (Appiah-Odame, 2).

Inclusion Strategies: Every student will be free to disseminate the knowledge by 

reporting in the chosen formats based on students’ advantages and preferences.

3. Peer and Self-Assessment

Description: In this learning activity, students are given a set of guidelines to assess their 

own and their group's members’ performances in the completion of an assigned group project.

Purpose: To monitor and encourage others as a means of following up on one’s/their 

actions and to learn how to provide constructive feedback.




6

Student Activities: Under teamwork, after several group assignments have been 

accomplished, the students will fill in a self-evaluation form and evaluate their colleagues as 

well.

Follow-Up: For instance, teachers will also organize discussion meetings aimed at 

reviewing the students’ assessments and establishing personal performance enhancements.

Rationale: Peer and self-assessment motivate learners to have ownership of the learning, 

and it also offers multiple viewpoints on performance.

Inclusion Strategies: The teachers will facilitate the tests and offer guidance that will 

help all student who may be having challenges with communication to be able to record good 

results.

Grade Weights

There is also the following division in terms of the plan of grading: formative and 

summative assessments help one get the overall picture of the student progress.

Formative Quizzes: 20% of the final grade

Project-Based Assessments: 50% of the final grade

Peer and Self-Assessments: 30% of the final grade

This distribution of workload ensures that every person is working and everyone is held 

responsible for their work as well as encouraging teamwork and professionalism.

Assessment Plan for One Unit (Weeks 5-7)

The unit under discussion is the one that uses place value and different forms of patterns 

while solving real-life problems, such as budgeting. This unit has been designed in such a way 

that students will have to come up with a group project that will reflect their understanding of 

some of the lessons learned in mathematics.




7

Assessment Technique 1: Quizzes on place value and pattern recognition

Assessment Technique 2: Collaborative project on budgeting

Assessment Technique 3: Peer and self-assessments of group work

These forms of assessments have many purposes, showing that students can be assessed. 

at various phases of the project academically.

Strategies for Inclusion

The assessment plan to be employed addresses the needs of a diverse population so that 

all the students may be facilitated to study. The facets of differentiation instruction and multiple-

choice formats for the assessment, as well as culturally relevant approaches, assist in meeting the 

diverse students’ needs. Other students that get help include ELL students who get help through 

the use of visual instruction and scaffolding, and special education students get help since they 

have individual needs.

Conclusion

This assessment plan is rather balanced to gauge the learning achievement of the 

students, eliciting students’ involvement as well as accommodating students with disabilities. 

Through the adoption of multiple assessment approaches, it becomes easier for teachers to 

identify the learning inputs and requirements as well as the learning outcomes of the learners that 

they teach. Other teachers can hence adopt this plan by only changing the content and the 

assessment strategies to their area of teaching and the specific objectives of the course. Student 

interaction as part of their learning and the emphasis on practical application make it possible for 

students to prepare for classroom work as well as real-life situations.

Food safety:   Have you ever thought about how every... | Science," 
Have you ever thought about how every country/region of the world has a unique cuisine or style of cooking? Mediterranean food is rich in olive oil, fresh fruits and vegetables, and fish. Mexican cuisine incorporates a lot of corn and chiles, two crops that grow well in the climate. Japanese cuisine includes a lot of rice, fish and seafood, plentiful in the island nation. 
The cuisine of any country or region is shaped and evolves throughout history as a combination of the natural resources available (because of geography and climate) and the religious or cultural traditions of the civilization. Trade routes and development of preservation techniques further shape the cuisine as people who face winters where it is too cold to grow fresh foods needed to find a way to preserve their harvest through the winter.
In today's world, there are also economic conditions that can impact a country's food supply and the safety of that food supply. Regions of the world that do not have modern infrastructure to support fresh safe water, clean sewage systems, or power for refrigeration face food safety barriers the rest of the world does not deal with on a daily basis.
For this discussion, choose a country or region of the world outside of the United States. Post that country/region as your discussion thread title, and be sure you are choosing a country/region that has not been written about by a classmate.
Do some internet research on the cuisine of that country/region and how it evolved throughout history. What are the main staples in the cuisine and why? What other societal or economic influences impact the cuisine and the safety of the food in that region? What food safety challenges are there in that country/region and why? How might those risks be reduced?

Analyzing Statement of Cash Flows," 
The purpose of this assignment is to analyze a statement of cash flows to determine the financial strengths and weaknesses of a company.
Understanding a company's major sources and uses of cash, and how cash is being used in the business through the analysis of the statement of cash flows, is essential. This analysis guides financial decision-making and is used to determine financial strengths and weaknesses within the company.
The accounting manager has asked you to prepare a 5- to 10-minute presentation for company stakeholders summarizing your analysis of the statement of cash flows and the financial strengths and weaknesses of the company.
Using the company that you selected from the approved list, review the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section of the annual report and the management’s discussion regarding the statement of cash flows or any discussion on the operating, investing, or financing activities of the company. In addition, refer to the statement of cash flows financial statement.
Create a PowerPoint presentation (5-8 slides) that summarizes your analysis and addresses the following. Include screenshots from the statement of cash flows as needed to illustrate key findings and information.
 

Discuss the company's major sources of cash in each of the three sections of the statement of cash flows. Provide at least two major sources of cash for each section.
Discuss the company's major uses of cash in each of the three sections of the statement of cash flows. Provide at least two major sources of cash for each section.
Discuss the major differences between the net income and the cash provided or used by operating activities, and explain the cause of the major difference between the two values. Note that you may need to reconcile the differences between net income reported and the subtotal of cash provided or used by ""operating"" activities. What were the reconciling items, how were these accounts adjusted, and why do we not just report ""net income"" without adjustments?
Summarize the financial strengths of the business and justify your analysis based on evidence in the statement of cash flows. Include discussion as to whether or not you anticipate the company will experience continued success and explain your answer. Only information from the statement of cash flow should be referenced. Note that this analysis will be more than just the amounts of either the cash provided or used. You may need to review the notes in the MD&A for additional information.
