Consider a situation where the price of a good rises when output,"This week, we learned that the interaction of supply and demand determines prices and output levels in markets. Prices and output levels change when either the demand curve or the supply curve shifts. Sometimes price and output both increase and decrease. Sometimes one increases while the other decreases.

Consider a situation where the price of a good rises when output increases.?For example,?lithium is used in rechargeable batteries for computers,?phones,?other electronic goods,?and even certain cars.?Demand for lithium was low as recently as the early?2000s.?Since then,?both the price of lithium and the production of lithium have more than doubled.
Start your discussion by responding to these questions:

What could explain the simultaneous increases in the price of lithium and the production of lithium??Use supply and demand curves to explain your answer.
Hint:?Price and equilibrium quantity have both increased. Would a shift in the demand curve or a shift in the supply curve lead to this result?",Economics,General Economics

Company Name: New-Trust Bank, Dallas TX
The bank is helping companies to do online transactions with the customers who hold their credit cards (New-Trust Bank Credit Card). The Bank has a headquarters in Dallas TX with 300 employees.
FDIC regulations require that  Banks must keep customer information (including contact, identification, and transactions) for five years after the account is closed.

Question 1: 
Client/Server  Network for  Intranet.
New-Trust Bank’s IT system is cable of processing 15,000 customers a day. All Customer accounts are kept in the Customer Accounts database and there is a backup system to fulfill the FDIC regulations. Customer transaction information has to be moved to the long-term memory (archive) for backup and to fulfill the FDIC regulations. This database is within the New-Trust Bank IT data center.  All company employees will be connected to the Customer Accounts database via the intranet.
Task: Develop a Client/Server diagram for the Bank’s management office intranet only. You should present the client computers (office PCs), network devices, the customer accounts database, and long-term data storage (archive) in your Intranet diagram.  You should not be specific about the number of computers in the LAN, you can use generic numbers for presentation purposes. For security reasons; there is no requirement for wireless devices. All connections must be via cable.
Your Intranet diagram has to have the following components
