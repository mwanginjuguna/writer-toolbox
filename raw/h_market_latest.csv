Ethical Decision-Making:   There may be instances when someone wi | Psychology," 
There may be instances when someone will seek mental health assistance and may not meet the full diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder, or they may not want a diagnosis on their record. It is the clinician’s responsibility to ensure they are using diagnosis in an ethical manner, according to the ACA Code of Ethics, along with the APA Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct. There may be times when a client questions their diagnosis and wants their case reviewed, possibly because of issues with insurance coverage, or they may believe their diagnosis will cause harm to them in other aspects of their life. 
Imagine you’re a consultant who reviews cases of potential ethical violations. A nonprofit mental health agency has hired you to review a recent case that came into question and determine if there was an ethical violation regarding the use of a diagnosis. The case was filed because the client disagrees with the diagnosis given and would like a different diagnosis. She is worried that the diagnosis given will be detrimental to her career and family life. The clinician has written a report justifying their use of the diagnosis for your review. You have been asked to present your findings to the agency board. 
 
Kassi is a 38-year-old White woman who came to the agency seeking substance abuse treatment. She mentioned that she needed to show her employer that she was taking appropriate measures to treat the issue, since it has impacted her productivity at work. 
Kassi stated that she works 40+ hours per week as an executive assistant and is also a single parent to a 14-year-old daughter. She reported that her job is quite stressful and requires her to be flexible with her schedule so that she can be available in the evenings, if needed. She mentioned that this causes her to be away from her daughter often, and she misses sporting events, band concerts, and other extracurricular activities and that has strained her relationship with her daughter. 
She reported that she often comes home and will have a whiskey on the rocks, and that sometimes turns into 3 or more drinks. She mentioned that this amount has increased over time. This has caused her to be late to work on more than one occasion, and completely miss work once or twice over the last 6 months because she is nauseous, anxious, and has trouble sleeping. Her daughter has mentioned her concern about her drinking since it has also caused her to miss some of her extracurricular activities and her daughter’s friends do not want to come over when Kassi is drinking. 
Kassi reported that she is only seeking treatment because her work is requiring it, but she does not believe she has a problem with alcohol. When reviewing the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder, Kassi meets criteria A. 1, 3, 5, 6, 10a, and 11a. Since this is 6 criteria, she was given a diagnosis of severe alcohol use disorder (303.90).

Derrick is a 35-year old African American advertising executive with a very hectic schedule. He’s fairly active, has a BMI of 23, and is in generally good health. However, at his annual physical, his doctor discovered that Derrick has high blood pressure. Derrick assures his doctor that he eats well and can’t understand why his numbers are so high. Derrick’s doctor recommends that he limit his salt intake and eat more whole foods rather than packaged products. Derrick takes his doctor’s advice to heart and takes the time to prepare some of his favorite meals. He takes a ham and cheese on rye sandwich to work instead of ordering Chinese food with his coworkers, even though it means giving up his favorite dish, General Tso’s Chicken. For dinner he has smoked trout with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli rather than his usual frozen dinners that have about 650mg of sodium. He no longer salts his food at the table. Derrick even replaces his usual snack of salted peanuts with dry cereal, his favorite being Corn Flakes. His bedtime snack is now a pudding cup instead of chips or salty, buttery popcorn. Derrick sips on water or 100% fruit juice during the day, but he rarely drinks milk.

After a month on his new diet, Derrick returns to his doctor, confident that his numbers are down. To his surprise, his blood pressure remains unchanged! “I don’t understand! I don’t put salt on anything and I’m eating whole foods!” he laments to his doctor.

Question 1: Derrick generally drinks water or juice to quench his thirst, and rarely milk. Although he gets some dairy from the pudding and cheese, he doesn’t consume much. Explain how this, in conjunction with his high sodium levels, affects his blood pressure. Support your answer with data, facts, key terminology, specific examples and other information drawn from the textbook and at least one other supplemental source.

Since living with her mother, she’s cut down on her smoking, but still smokes about 5 cigarettes per day and a little more when she’s out with friends. Ellie’s diet consists of lean protein, fruits and some starchy vegetables, but no dairy as she’s lactose intolerant and has been since she was a child.

Gwen Gullible was married to Darrell Devious. They were divorced two years ago. Three years ago (the year before their divorce), Darrell received a $500,000 retirement plan distribution, of which $100,000 was rolled over into an IRA. At the time, Gwen was aware of the retirement funds and the rollover. The distribution was used to pay off the couple’s mortgage, purchase a car, and cover living expenses. Darrell prepared the couple’s joint return, and Gwen asked him about the tax ramifications of the retirement dis-tributions. He told her he had consulted a CPA and was advised that the retirement plan proceeds used to pay off a mortgage were not taxable income. Gwen accepted that explanation and signed the return. In fact, Darrell had not consulted a CPA.One year ago (after the divorce), Gwen received a letter from the IRS saying it had not received the tax return for the last full year of marriage. On advice from a CPA, Gwen immediately filed the return (she had a signed copy of the unfiled joint return). The IRS notified Gwen that no estimated payments on the retirement distribution had been paid by Darrell, and that she owed $140,000 in tax, plus penal-ties and interest.a.List as many possible tax research issues as you can to determine whether Gwen is liable for the tax, interest, and penalties.b.After completing your list of tax research issues, list the keywords you might use to construct an online tax research query.c.Execute an online search using your query.

patho 2: Hematopoietic: J.D. is a 37 years old wh | Nursing,"Hematopoietic:
J.D. is a 37 years old white woman who presents to her gynecologist complaining of a 2-month history of intermenstrual bleeding, menorrhagia, increased urinary frequency, mild incontinence, extreme fatigue, and weakness. Her menstrual period occurs every 28 days and lately there have been 6 days of heavy flow and cramping. She denies abdominal distension, back-ache, and constipation. She has not had her usual energy levels since before her last pregnancy.

Past Medical History (PMH):
Upon reviewing her past medical history, the gynecologist notes that her patient is a G5P5with four pregnancies within four years, the last infant having been delivered vaginally four months ago. All five pregnancies were unremarkable and without delivery complications. All infants were born healthy. Patient history also reveals a 3-year history of osteoarthritis in the left knee, probably the result of sustaining significant trauma to her knee in an MVA when she was 9 years old. When asked what OTC medications she is currently taking for her pain and for how long she has been taking them, she reveals that she started taking ibuprofen, three tablets each day, about 2.5 years ago for her left knee. Due to a slowly progressive increase in pain and a loss of adequate relief with three tablets, she doubled the daily dose of ibuprofen. Upon the recommendation from her nurse practitioner and because long-term ibuprofen use can cause peptic ulcers, she began taking OTC omeprazole on a regular basis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding. Patient history also reveals a 3-year history of HTN for which she is now being treated with a diuretic and a centrally acting antihypertensive drug. She has had no previous surgeries.

Case Study Questions

Name the contributing factors on J.D that might put her at risk to develop iron deficiency anemia.
Within the case study, describe the reasons why J.D. might be presenting constipation and or dehydration.
Why Vitamin B12 and folic acid are important on the erythropoiesis? What abnormalities their deficiency might cause on the red blood cells?
The gynecologist is suspecting that J.D. might be experiencing iron deficiency anemia.
In order to support the diagnosis, list and describe the clinical symptoms that J.D. might have positive for Iron deficiency anemia.
If the patient is diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia, what do you expect to find as signs of this type of anemia? List and describe.
Labs results came back for the patient. Hb 10.2 g/dL; Hct 30.8%; Ferritin 9 ng/dL; red blood cells are smaller and paler in color than normal. Research list and describe for appropriate recommendations and treatments for J.D.

Cardiovascular
Mr. W.G. is a 53-year-old white man who began to experience chest discomfort while playing tennis with a friend. At first, he attributed his discomfort to the heat and having had a large breakfast. Gradually, however, discomfort intensified to a crushing sensation in the sternal area and the pain seemed to spread upward into his neck and lower jaw. The nature of the pain did not seem to change with deep breathing. When Mr. G. complained of feeling nauseated and began rubbing his chest, his tennis partner was concerned that his friend was having a heart attack and called 911 on his cell phone. The patient was transported to the ED of the nearest hospital and arrived within 30 minutes of the onset of chest pain. In route to the hospital, the patient was placed on nasal cannula and an IV D5W was started. Mr. G. received aspirin (325 mg po) and 2 mg/IV morphine. He is allergic to meperidine (rash). His pain has eased slightly in the last 15 minutes but is still significant; was 9/10 in severity; now7/10. In the ED, chest pain was not relieved by 3 SL NTG tablets. He denies chills.

Topic: My idea is to identify course topics such as schemas, specifically the Schematic 
Processing Principle, the forgetting curve, and flashbulb memories to make sense of the 
experience I had when I broke my left arm in fifth grade at a trampoline park and how I 
still vividly remember it. 
 
Instructions.  Use the following section headings: 

1. Issue.  Begin by describing the personal goal, problem, experience, or 
phenomenon that you will be addressing.  Explain briefly why it is interesting 
or important to you. (One paragraph) 

2. Course Topics. Identify the topics from the course that you will be applying, 
including the relevant facts or theories you will make use of. (One paragraph) 

3. Application.  Apply information from the course to analyze your experience, 
create a plan for achieving your goal, find a solution to your problem, etc.  Be 
sure to cite the specific sources for the ideas you are applying.  You can also 
refer to general principles from the course readings and lectures.  (2 to 3 
pages) 

4. Empirical Evaluation.  Evaluate the strength of the evidence for the ""facts"" 
you are applying from topics in the course.  If, for example, you applied the 
idea of ""retrieval practice"" to help you study more effectively, you might say 
something like, ""The idea that retrieval practice leads to better memory is 
something we can be highly confident is true, because it has been repeatedly 
supported by well-controlled experimental evidence.""  Or if you applied the 
idea of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs to identify things that were interfering 
with your academic achievement you might say, ""Although intuitively 
appealing, the ideas described in Maslow's Hierarchy are things we can have 
very little confidence are true, because they are mostly based on only intuition 
and observational research, not repeated and well-controlled 
experiments.""  Try to cite specific empirical evidence to support your 
conclusions whenever possible.  This can include primary sources such as 
journal articles.  (The library has a Guide for Research that is very helpful.) (2 
to 3 pages) 

5. Conclusion.  Sum up what you have done, and briefly discuss which 
information from the course you found most applicable to your issue.  Also 
briefly talk about what questions you still have or what further information you 
think you might need.  (1 to 2 paragraphs). 

6. References.  Provide an APA-style reference list for any source you used in 
your paper, whether it is a journal article, textbook chapter, course lecture, 
website, content-generating tool such as an AI system, or anything else that 
is not common knowledge or your own words and ideas.  Each entry in the 
References list should also correspond to an APA-style in-text citation in the 
text of your paper.  Each entry in the References list must include a DOI, or if 
no DOI is available it must include a URL that links to the source.

You are the early childhood teacher in the toddler room. Increasingly, you notice some of your 
colleagues have a deficit view of the toddlers in their care. Your colleagues demonstrate behaviours 
that suggest the toddlers are not capable of making choices and completing routines on their own.  

Critically analyse this learning environment in terms of a) the need for children’s agency and b) the 
practices you would implement for improved children’s agency in this setting. 

When synthesising your response, justify your analysis with one NQS Quality Area (ACECQA, 2020), 
one EYLF Principle and one EYLF Practice (AGDE, 2022) and academic literature.  



Scenario 2 

As the early childhood teacher responsible for the Preschool room at a long day care service, you are 
eager to introduce a healthier eating program. Your goal is to involve both families and the 
community in this initiative. Your service caters to a diverse range of family backgrounds, each with 
unique cultural influences and dietary requirements and preferences.  

How can you effectively implement a healthier eating program, considering the diverse backgrounds 
and preferences? Additionally, how can you ensure participation and support from both families and 
the broader community in this initiative?   

When constructing your response, justify your answer with one NQS Quality Area (ACECQA, 2020), 
one EYLF Principle and one EYLF Practice (AGDE, 2022) and academic literature. 



Scenario 3 

You are the educator in the 0–2-year-old room. You have a number of new families who are 
concerned about their children who become very upset at drop-off time. You are to formulate a 
strategy that will enable you to a) reassure the new families that their children’s behaviour is 
common, and b) communicate to the families the practices you undertake to settle the children each 
morning and build trust.  

When detailing the strategy use one NQS Quality Area (ACECQA, 2020), one EYLF Principle and one 
EYLF Practice (AGDE, 2022) and academic literature to justify your decisions, and the importance of 
these for the child and family.

Your proposal for the integration of drones in emergency and disaster management operations is commendable and should be value added to the EM community. Your problem statement is clear in the respect that it highlights the potential for drones to overcome historical challenges in response operations. The inclusion of a mixed methods approach, paired with using existing literature/policy, strengthens the context of your research and emphasizes a holistic understanding of the topic. As such, this thesis proposal seeks to improve gaps in knowledge and practices, therefore, effectively enhances the capability and capacity of emergency and disaster management. Overall, your proposal demonstrates a comprehensive approach to advance knowledge in the field and should yield a fruitful outcome.

Cloud security power point : The CIO and CFO have been working on a n | Computer Science,"The CIO and CFO have been working on a new plan to save money by moving a majority of their workload to the cloud. They didn’t bring the CISO into the mix until the last steps of planning, and they’ve already chosen a mixture of SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS tools to meet their requirements. These spans a variety of cloud providers as the CIO said it would increase resilience if one cloud provider became unavailable.

Who bears the majority of security responsibility with an IaaS provider? A PaaS? A SaaS?
What are some of the basic tenets of cloud security?
Is security more difficult in a multi-cloud environment? If so, would the loss of the additional resilience (as stated by the CIO) by moving to a single cloud provider be worth it?

It is not feasible for advanced human services professional practitioners to be familiar with the cultural values, beliefs, and norms of every cultural group present within a community they serve. Being a successful practitioner in this era of diversity does, however, require that you practice open-mindedness, acknowledge possible differences without judgment, and research or seek guidance about culturally sensitive and ethically sound interventions. It also requires that you consider how the evolving context in which you work influences how you respond to service users.
In this Discussion, you will respond to one of the case studies in the Hart City community. In doing so, you will examine cultural and ethical considerations related to working with the service user in the case study as well as how a recent current event might influence your approach.

CASE STUDY SELECTION 



 

Matthew

Matthew is a single 40-year-old African American male. He was admitted to the Hart City Rehabilitation Facility (HCRF) following a brain injury. His complex medical history includes alcohol and cocaine abuse, lung disease, and other problems. He has a criminal record for theft, experienced chronic unemployment, and lived alone in a home owned by a relative who occasionally provided him with a meal. Matthew lacks financial resources, such as a bank account or social service benefits. He cannot verbalize any long-term goals or plans for himself. Upon admission to the HCRF, Matthew requested that an advanced human services professional practitioner assist him with applying for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. He also reported that there had been a fire at his relative’s house and that he was eligible for $7,500 in insurance claims for the loss of his personal belongings in the fire. He did not want the relative contacted and, instead, requested that the advanced human services professional practitioner contact the insurance company, file the claim, and collect the benefits. Matthew is clearly vulnerable, and he needs assistance. However, given Matthew’s history and recent brain injury, there is a very strong possibility that Matthew’s claim is not valid, as it does not look like Matthew had $7,500 in personal possessions. The advanced human services professional practitioner may participate in fraud if they help file Matthew’s claim.

Stating the null and alternative hypotheses correctly is crucial to using data to answer research questions. Stating it in words and using statistical notation is also vital to make sure everyone is clear on what needs to be tested in order to answer the research question. But is there only one correct way to state in words the null and alternative hypotheses to address the health question you are studying?



For your initial post state in words the null and alternative hypotheses for your chosen health question. Then present both hypotheses again using statistical notation. Next, discuss if there is another way that you can word your hypotheses and maintain the same meaning as your original wording, and present this alternative wording.



CHOSEN HEALTH QUESTION




Does Age Affect the Survival (Follow-up Status) of MI Patients?

The question asks if age has an impact on the survival chances of MI patients. MI stands for Myocardial Infarction which is commonly referred to as heart attack (Institute of Medicine, 2010). When people grow older, their body organs become weaker, and their functionality drops. This implies that an older patient's heart is not as strong as a young person's and in case of a heart attack, the mortality rate for older people is higher. The long-term survival of patients aged 65 and above with acute myocardial infarction is 65% (Kappagoda & Greenwood, 2012). Age affects the survival of MI patients. Younger patients have greater survival rates than older ones. The younger population is generally healthier and stronger; therefore, they have better chances. Their immunity is also higher and this generally boosts their health (Morrow, 2016). On the contrary, the older population is weaker and has minimal chances of surviving a heart attack.

Supportive and positive interaction between caregivers and aphasia children is crucial for nurturing healthy attachment bonds. These interactions, characterized by mutual respect, enjoyment, and engagement, play a pivotal role in reinforcing the child's sense of worth and fostering their social and emotional development. Through playful activities and shared experiences, children with aphasia learn essential life skills, such as communication, problem-solving, and empathy, all within the safety and security of a nurturing relationship.
Encouraging exploration is a delicate yet essential aspect of caregiving for aphasia children. Caregivers must strike a balance between providing a safe environment and allowing the child to explore independently. A secure attachment empowers children to venture into the world with confidence, knowing they have a supportive caregiver to rely on. By encouraging exploration and autonomy, caregivers promote the development of independence, self-confidence, and adaptability in aphasia children.
Respecting the child's growing autonomy is another key behavior that nurses advocate for. This involves acknowledging the child's ability to make age-appropriate decisions and supporting their efforts to solve problems independently. By respecting the child's autonomy, caregivers not only bolster the child's self-esteem and decision-making skills but also strengthen the caregiver-child bond through mutual respect and understanding.
Sensitive discipline is integral to promoting healthy attachment in aphasia children. Rather than resorting to punitive measures, sensitive discipline focuses on setting clear, consistent boundaries in a loving and supportive manner. This approach helps children understand the consequences of their actions within a framework of respect and guidance, fostering internal regulation and a sense of right and wrong without instilling fear or resentment.
Moreover, nurses can provide education and guidance to caregivers on effective communication strategies tailored to the unique needs of aphasia children. By teaching caregivers how to adapt their communication styles and utilize devices, nurses empower caregivers to effectively engage with their children and support their language development. This proactive approach not only strengthens the caregiver-child bond but also enhances the child's ability to communicate, fostering a sense of connection and understanding within the parent-child relationship.
In summary, nurses play a vital role in supporting caregivers of aphasia children in fostering healthy attachment relationships. By promoting supportive and positive interactions, encouraging exploration and autonomy, and employing sensitive discipline strategies, nurses empower caregivers to provide the nurturing environment necessary for the emotional and social development of aphasia children. Through these efforts, nurses contribute to the overall well-being and resilience of aphasia children and their families.

Attachment theory
Based on the theory of attachment, what behaviors would a nurse attempt to stimulate when working with parents to promote health attachment?
A nurse working with parents to create a healthy attachment will specifically urge four fundamental behaviors. Here are some instances of these actions: Attunement, participation, sensitivity, and responsiveness are some of the behaviors that fall under this category. The ability of a parent to discern their child's emotional cues and react suitably is known as ""sensitivity."" A perceptive parent may recognize when their child is feeling anxious, angry, or scared and react in a way that comforts and uplifts the child. This hypothesis states that during infancy and the early years of life, babies and young children develop strong emotional relationships with their primary caregivers, which is essential for the child's psychological and social development. It is an attachment like a two-way relationship. (Devacht, 2019)
A nurse working with families to create a healthy attachment will specifically urge four fundamental behaviors. Here are some instances of these actions: Attunement, participation, sensitivity, and responsiveness are some of the behaviors that fall under this category.
Thus, the youngster looks to the caregiver for comfort and security while the caregiver offers the child support and comfort. This is due to the child's perception that connection-making is a process that goes both ways.  There is proof that this theory ties formed in early life can have a big influence on someone's life. Numerous human characteristics, such as attachment types, bonding, and attachment disorders, have been explained by attachment theory. The foundation for attachment theory was established by the British physician and psychoanalyst John Bowlby. John Bowlby's observations of children in facilities like hospitals and orphanages had a significant influence on his attachment study. He noticed that children who received insufficient care typically had emotional and behavioral issues. Speaking of responsiveness, we indicate the parent's capacity to promptly and appropriately attend to their children's needs. A responsive parent is conscious of their child's needs and meets those needs at the right times and with the right amount of care, attention, and support. (Heo, 2019)
The ability of a parent to establish a loving and caring relationship with their children is referred to as engagement. A caring and involved parent interacts with their child in a joyful and loving way and provides a supportive and nurturing atmosphere for them. One term for a parent's capacity to sense their child's emotional state is ""attunement."" According to Bowlby's theory of attachment, attachment develops over four stages: 
1. Between four and twelve weeks after birth is when the pre-attachment stage occurs. The infant is more concerned with taking care of themselves and does not yet form a close bond with a particular caregiver.
2. The period of attachment development is thought to occur between six weeks and seven months of age. Because they have developed a bond with their primary caregiver, infants experience symptoms of separation anxiety when they are taken from them.
3. Between the ages of seven months and two years is when the connection reaches its crystal-clear stage. The infant is upset if they are taken away from their primary caregiver because they have developed a close bond with them.
4. Relationships that are reciprocal: This phase begins at about the two-year mark and lasts until the partnership dissolves. Although the child can develop relationships with other people, they have a close bond with their primary caregiver. (Devacht, 2019)

Follow each statement with a 50-75 word paragraph describing how each fact affects learning or brain development that promotes growth for students with physical, cognitive, or socioemotional needs. Provide at least one scholarly resource for each statement.

Example:



Fact: The amygdala is the brain’s emotional control center.



The amygdala regulates the brain’s response to emotions such as fear, excitement, and pleasure.   As part of the brain’s limbic system, it is located next to the hippocampus – the part of the brain that plays a significant role in converting information from working memory to long-term memory.   Exposure to long-term stress has been found to cause damage to the amygdala which may account for why some students, particularly those from poverty, struggle to regulate their emotions and behavior (Lau, et al., 2016).

 Part 2:  Reflection
Select two of the facts from your Top 5 list, and in 250-500 words, reflect on and describe ways in which the brain affects learning, constructs knowledge, acquires skills, and develops thinking processes.

Coordination Analysis and Reflection,"BACKGROUND: Imagine you are applying for a position at a local health care organization. Since culture is important to workplace satisfaction, you plan to examine their organizational behavior to determine if you will be a good fit for them and if they will be a good fit for you. But first you need to complete a self-assessment on what creates a good fit for you. The best way to self-assess is to examine current and past work experience. This assessment will help you determine the impact and application of organizational behavior. It may provide some insight into how health care managers can use their coordinating skills to improve the overall team and organizational behavior.
Preparing for the Assessment
Consider the Infographic below. Organizational behavior starts and ends with people, particularly how individuals, groups, and the organization communicate and interact with each other – positively or negatively. Research aspects of culture and organizational behavior as you complete the grid for this assessment. (Keep scrolling for further directions)

Assessment Deliverable
Use the circle grid as inspiration as you develop your responses to the following prompts for an organization you currently work for or one you worked for in the past. Note: The organization you choose doesn’t have to be health care specific. 
This is a self-assessment activity and needs to be understandable to the reader. Use the WORD document ""Week 2 Summative Assessment template"" provided below to respond to each of the questions In Part 1. Consider phrase or sentence-length answer for each of the prompts. Then in the same document write your reflection for Part 2 listed below. 
You will be using the WORD document template attached below for Part 1 and Part 2 of this assignment. It is required. If the WORD document attached here is not used, a 10% deduction will be assessed without the chance of resubmission.

Paper 1: Reword this so it doesn't look like it's | Criminal,Reword this so it doesn't look like it's AI generated,Paper1.docx,Paper1.docx,"Title: Understanding the Founding Documents: Essential Knowledge for Criminal Justice Professionals

The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights stand as foundational documents that shape the principles and framework of the United States' legal and political system. For criminal justice professionals, a comprehensive understanding of these documents is essential, as they provide the basis for the rights, liberties, and responsibilities within the criminal justice system. By delving into the historical context and significance of these documents, criminal justice professionals can gain valuable insights into the principles that guide their work and the rights of individuals within the justice system.

Historical Facts Concerning the Adoption of the Founding Documents:

1. 
            Declaration of Independence:
        
· The Declaration of Independence, adopted on July 4, 1776, marks the United States' formal break from British rule. It was primarily authored by Thomas Jefferson and declared the colonies' grievances against King George III, asserting their right to self-governance and independence.
· Importance for Criminal Justice Professionals: Understanding the principles outlined in the Declaration of Independence provides criminal justice professionals with insight into the foundational values of liberty, equality, and individual rights. This document emphasizes the importance of government accountability and the protection of citizens' rights against tyranny and oppression. Criminal justice professionals should recognize that the pursuit of justice must be grounded in the principles of individual liberty and equality before the law (Declaration of Independence: A History).
2. 
            Constitution:
        
· The Constitution of the United States, ratified in 1788, establishes the framework of the federal government and outlines the powers and responsibilities of its branches. It replaced the weaker Articles of Confederation and sought to create a more stable and unified nation.
· Importance for Criminal Justice Professionals: The Constitution serves as the supreme law of the land, shaping the structure and operation of the criminal justice system. Criminal justice professionals must be familiar with the Constitution's provisions, including the separation of powers, due process rights, and limitations on government authority. For example, the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, while the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to a fair trial. Understanding these constitutional protections is essential for ensuring that law enforcement practices and procedures comply with constitutional standards (A More Perfect Union).
3. 
            Bill of Rights:
        
· The Bill of Rights, comprising the first ten amendments to the Constitution, was adopted in 1791 to address concerns about individual liberties and further limit government power. It safeguards fundamental rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and the right to a fair trial.
· Importance for Criminal Justice Professionals: The Bill of Rights serves as a critical safeguard against government overreach and abuse of power within the criminal justice system. Criminal justice professionals must uphold and protect the rights enshrined in the Bill of Rights, including the right to due process, protection against self-incrimination, and the prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. For example, the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination ensures that individuals are not coerced into confessing to crimes, while the Eighth Amendment prohibits excessive bail and cruel punishments. Knowledge of these rights is essential for ensuring fair and just outcomes in criminal proceedings (Questions and Answers Pertaining to the Constitution).

Conclusion:

In conclusion, an understanding of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights is indispensable for criminal justice professionals. These documents provide the framework for the principles of justice, liberty, and individual rights that underpin the criminal justice system. By recognizing the historical context and significance of these founding documents, criminal justice professionals can better fulfill their roles in upholding the rule of law, protecting individual liberties, and promoting justice for all.

Week 3 Discussion: Nursing Leadership and Change Management

Being cost conscious as a nurse and a nurse leader can be challenging. There are multiple considerations that contribute to cost-consciousness that should be kept in mind. As direct caregivers, nurses are often involved in determining the type and quantity of resources used for patients. This includes supplies, personnel, and time. Decisions made by nurse leaders will directly impact the cost of care for patients cared for within their organization.
In this week’s discussion, reflect on the role of the nurse leader in fiscal management decision making. Address the following:
· Provide two different examples that demonstrate how nurse leaders can impact cost of care through cost-containment efforts surrounding budgeting, expense reporting, personnel/staffing decisions, or reimbursement.
· Discuss how implementing evidence-based practice can contribute to cost-containment efforts within healthcare organizations.
· Provide one example of an evidence-based change that can impact healthcare costs.
· Reflect on your work as a nurse. After reviewing the content in this module, how will your practice change in the future concerning fiscal and resource management? What specific changes will you make in your practice?",Nursing,Nursing|Leadership,https://www.sweetstudy.com/questions/prof-nursing-leadership-week3-discussion

D at: Deciding to monitor treatment and then c | Psychology,"Deciding to monitor treatment and then committing to that decision, are the first hurdles that must be passed in the development and implementation of any type of monitoring process or program. This can be a difficult endeavor. Once passed, the clinician must make another difficult decision, that is, which variable(s) to monitor.
It is no simple matter to determine exactly what should be measured and monitored. In the end, the most important variables to monitor are those that are tied to the patient’s goals and objectives.

As a nurse, how often have you thought to yourself, 
            If I had anything to do about it, things would work a little differently? Increasingly, nurses are beginning to realize that they do, in fact, have a role and a voice.
        
Many nurses encounter daily experiences that motivate them to take on an advocacy role in hopes of impacting policies, laws, or regulations that impact healthcare issues of interest. Of course, doing so means entering the less familiar world of policy and politics. While many nurses do not initially feel prepared to operate in this space effectively, the reward is the opportunity to shape and influence future health policy.

Objectives
Part 1: Design a Network Subnetting Scheme
Part 2: Configure the Devices
Part 3: Test and Troubleshoot the Network
Background / Scenario
In this lab, starting from a single network address and network mask, you will subnet the network into multiple subnets. The subnet scheme should be based on the number of host computers required in each subnet, as well as other network considerations, like future network host expansion.
After you have created a subnetting scheme and completed the network diagram by filling in the host and interface IP addresses, you will configure the host PCs and router interfaces, including loopback interfaces. The loopback interfaces are created to simulate additional LANs attached to router R1.
After the network devices and host PCs have been configured, you will use the 
            ping command to test for network connectivity.
        
This lab provides minimal assistance with the actual commands necessary to configure the router. However, the required commands are provided in Appendix A. Test your knowledge by trying to configure the devices without referring to the appendix.

Note: The routers used with CCNA hands-on labs are Cisco 1941 Integrated Services Routers (ISRs) with Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)M3 (universalk9 image). The switches used are Cisco Catalyst 2960s with Cisco IOS Release 15.0(2) (lanbasek9 image). Other routers, switches and Cisco IOS versions can be used. Depending on the model and Cisco IOS version, the commands available and output produced might vary from what is shown in the labs. Refer to the Router Interface Summary Table at this end of the lab for the correct interface identifiers.
        

Note: Make sure that the routers and switches have been erased and have no startup configurations. If you are unsure, contact your instructor.
        
Required Resources
1 Router (Cisco 1941 with Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)M3 universal image or comparable)
1 Switch (Cisco 2960 with Cisco IOS Release 15.0(2) lanbasek9 image or comparable)
2 PCs (Windows 7 or 8 with terminal emulation program, such as Tera Term)
Console cables to configure the Cisco IOS devices via the console ports
Ethernet cables as shown in the topology

Note: The Gigabit Ethernet interfaces on Cisco 1941 routers are autosensing. An Ethernet straight-through cable may be used between the router and PC-B. If using another Cisco router model, it may be necessary to use an Ethernet crossover cable.
        
Design a Network Subnetting Scheme
Create a subnetting scheme that meets the required number of subnets and required number of host addresses.
In this scenario, you are a network administrator for a small subdivision within a larger company. You must create multiple subnets out of the 192.168.0.0/24 network address space to meet the following requirements:
The first subnet is the employee network. You need a minimum of 25 host IP addresses.
The second subnet is the administration network. You need a minimum of 10 IP addresses.
The third and fourth subnets are reserved as virtual networks on virtual router interfaces, loopback 0 and loopback 1. These virtual router interfaces simulate LANs attached to R1.
You also need two additional unused subnets for future network expansion.

Note: Variable length subnet masks will not be used. All of the device subnet masks will be the same length.
        
Answer the following questions to help create a subnetting scheme that meets the stated network requirements:
How many host addresses are needed in the largest required subnet? _____________________ 
What is the minimum number of subnets required? _________________________________
The network that you are tasked to subnet is 192.168.0.0/24. What is the /24 subnet mask in binary?
________________________________________________________________________________
The subnet mask is made up of two portions, the network portion, and the host portion. This is represented in the binary by the ones and the zeros in the subnet mask.
In the network mask, what do the ones represent? ________________________________________
In the network mask, what do the zeros represent? _______________________________________


To subnet a network, bits from the host portion of the original network mask are changed into subnet bits. The number of subnet bits defines the number of subnets. Given each of the possible subnet masks depicted in the following binary format, how many subnets and how many hosts are created in each example?

Hint: Remember that the number of host bits (to the power of 2) defines the number of hosts per subnet (minus 2), and the number of subnet bits (to the power of two) defines the number of subnets. The subnet bits (depicted in bold type face) are the bits that have been borrowed beyond the original network mask of /24. The /24 is the slash prefix notation and corresponds to a dotted decimal mask of 255.255.255.0.
        
(/25) 11111111.11111111.11111111.
            10000000
        
Dotted decimal subnet mask equivalent: ________________________________
Number of subnets? ________________, Number of hosts? ________________
 (/26) 11111111.11111111.11111111.
            11000000
        
Dotted decimal subnet mask equivalent: ________________________________
Number of subnets? ________________, Number of hosts? ________________

Dotted decimal subnet mask equivalent: ________________________________
Number of subnets? ________________ Number of hosts? ________________

Dotted decimal subnet mask equivalent: ________________________________
Number of subnets? ________________ Number of hosts? _________________
 (/29) 11111111.11111111.11111111.
            11111000
        
Dotted decimal subnet mask equivalent: ________________________________
Number of subnets? ________________ Number of hosts? _________________
 (/30) 11111111.11111111.11111111.
            11111100
        
Dotted decimal subnet mask equivalent: ________________________________
Number of subnets? ________________ Number of hosts? _________________
Considering your answers, which subnet masks meet the required number of minimum host addresses?
________________________________________________________________________________
Considering your answers, which subnet masks meets the minimum number of subnets required?
________________________________________________________________________________
Considering your answers, which subnet mask meets both the required minimum number of hosts and the minimum number of subnets required?
________________________________________________________________________________


When you have determined which subnet mask meets all of the stated network requirements, you will derive each of the subnets starting from the original network address. List the subnets from first to last below. Remember that the first subnet is 192.168.0.0 with the newly acquired subnet mask.

Complete the diagram showing where the host IP addresses will be applied.
On the following lines provided, fill in the IP addresses and subnets masks in slash prefix notation. On the router, use the first usable address in each subnet for each of the interfaces, Gigabit Ethernet 0/0, Gigabit Ethernet 0/1, loopback 0, and loopback 1. Fill in an IP address for both PC-A and PC-B. Also enter this information into the Addressing Table on Page 1.



Configure the Devices
In Part 2, set up the network topology and configure basic settings on the PCs and router, such as the router Gigabit Ethernet interface IP addresses, and the PC’s IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways. Refer to the Addressing Table for device names and address information.

Note: Appendix A provides configuration details for the steps in Part 2. You should attempt to complete Part 2 prior to reviewing Appendix A.
        


Configure the router.
Enter into privileged EXEC mode and then global config mode.
Assign the 
            R1 as the hostname for the router.
        
Configure both the 
            G0/0 and 
            G0/1 interfaces with IP addresses and subnet masks, and then enable them.
        
Loopback interfaces are created to simulate additional LANs on R1 router. Configure the loopback interfaces with IP addresses and subnet masks. After they are created, loopback interfaces are enabled, by default. (To create the loopback addresses, enter the command 
            interface loopback 0 at the global config mode)
        

Note: You can create additional loopbacks for testing with different addressing schemes, if desired.
        
Save the running configuration to the startup configuration file.
Configure the PC interfaces.
Configure the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway settings on PC-A.
Configure the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway settings on PC-B.
Test and Troubleshoot the Network
In Part 3, you will use the 
            ping command to test network connectivity.
        
Test to see if PC-A can communicate with its default gateway. From PC-A, open a command prompt and ping the IP address of the router Gigabit Ethernet 0/1 interface. Do you get a reply? _________________
Test to see if PC-B can communicate with its default gateway. From PC-B, open a command prompt and ping the IP address of the router Gigabit Ethernet 0/0 interface. Do you get a reply? ________________
Test to see if PC-A can communicate with PC-B. From PC-A, open a command prompt and ping the IP address of PC-B. Do you get a reply? _________________
If you answered “no” to any of the preceding questions, then you should go back and check all of your IP address and subnet mask configurations, and ensure that the default gateways have been correctly configured on PC-A and PC-B.
If you verify that all of the settings are correct, and you can still not ping successfully, then there are a few additional factors that can block ICMP pings. On PC-A and PC-B within Windows, make sure that the Windows Firewall is turned off for the Work, Home, and Public networks.
Experiment by purposely misconfiguring the gateway address on PC-A to 10.0.0.1. What happens when you try and ping from PC-B to PC-A? Do you receive a reply?
____________________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________________
Reflection
Subnetting one larger network into multiple smaller subnetworks allows for greater flexibility and security in network design. However, what do you think some of the drawbacks are when the subnets are limited to being the same size?
_______________________________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________________________
Why do you think the gateway/router IP address is usually the first usable IP address in the network?

Key Principles and Best Practices for Leveraging Frameworks in Nursing Practice 
Big data encompasses significant information that can be utilized to drive evidence-based practice (Orthop, 2020). For example, big data is becoming increasingly advanced and helpful in analyzing information (Orthop, 2020). Big data minimizes confusion and organizes information that can be easier to interpret, such as in value-based healthcare. For example, researchers use big data to compare broad scopes of information to improve health outcomes amongst the varying population groups (Orthop, 2020). Some correlations could surface that might not have occurred to a researcher with only minimal data (Orthop, 2020). Lastly, the importance and application of implementation science, change theory, and systems, coupled with theories and how they provide a framework to guide projects will be discussed (Orthop, 2020).      
Informatic Frameworks Applicable to Healthcare Organizations and Nursing 
Analytical models allow clinicians to make effective decisions (Ellis, 2023). Analytical models pave the way for theoretical frameworks in nursing informatics (Ellis, 2023). For example, decision-making models are used to assist individuals and focus groups in organizing and providing feedback before making decisions (Ellis, 2023). Applying Lewin's change theory is essential as it is a framework to guide DNP quality improvement initiatives (Ellis, 2023). Lewin's change theory was developed by Kurt Lewin in 1940 (Ellis, 2023).  
Lewin's change theory encompasses three stages of organizational behavior: unfreezing, changing, and refreezing (Ellis, 2023). Lewin's change theory is instrumental in identifying problems such as practice gap concerns (Ellis, 2023). Stakeholders can also utilize brainstorming approaches and potentiate possible options throughout the planning and decision-making process (Ellis, 2023). Cost and benefit options are necessary to ensure that the quality improvement team works within the budget's confinements (Ellis, 2023). Constrained budgets with minimal room for adjustment can also affect decision-making (Ellis, 2023). Lewin's change theory allows stakeholders to buy in and implement effective changes in daily clinical practices (Ellis, 2023). 
Research and Potential for Great Social Impact   
The COVID-19 pandemic big data was used to identify vulnerable population groups and their effects on the healthcare economy (Galetsi et al., 2022). For example, big data was used to manage the spread of the COVID-19 virus pandemic (Galetsi et al., 2022). Big data enables large amounts of data to be processed over short periods (Galetsi et al., 2022). Barriers to managing big data are challenged by ethical and privacy concerns (Galetsi et al., 2022). Big data requires clinical skills and understanding the importance of collecting and analyzing data using health information technology (Galetsi et al., 2022). Big data analytics tools are integral in making decisions and measuring quality of safety (Galetsi et al., 2022). 
Theories and Models Influence on Guiding Projects. 
Theories and models provide a framework to guide projects by instilling an organized structure. In the case of the writer's DNP project on staff education, Lewin's Change Theory provides a three-stage outline of implementation (Eder & Dignath, 2022). The three stages of unfreezing, changing, and refreezing facilitate slowly dissolving the existing behavior, introducing the new behavior, and cementing the new behavior (Eder & Dignath, 2022). Lewin's theory is based on driving and resisting forces, with the change resulting from a more vital driving force. (Eder & Dignath, 2022). 
Transtheoretical Model of Change 
Prochaska and DiClemente developed the Transtheoretical Model of Change (TTM) in the late 1970s (Hunter, 2024; Prochaska & Velicer, 1997). TTM allows individuals to progress through six stages of change: pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance, and termination (Hunter, 2024; Prochaska & Velicer, 1997). For example, in a smoking cessation program, the TTM can help identify individuals' readiness to quit smoking and tailor interventions accordingly (Hunter, 2024). By understanding the stages of change, healthcare professionals can develop targeted strategies to support individuals' journeys toward healthier lifestyles (Hunter, 2024). 
Application in Research and Projects 
Theories and models, such as the Transtheoretical Model of Change and Social Network Analysis, provide a framework to guide projects, including DNP Projects or dissertations (Purnell et al., 2023). They help researchers and practitioners understand the context, identify barriers, and develop targeted strategies to facilitate change and improve outcomes (Purnell et al., 2023). The DNP Project focused on improving access to mental healthcare will improve clinical guidelines for practice gap concerns (Purnell et al., 2023). Clinical guidelines for evidence-based practice change are contingent on implementing collaborative practice and the Transtheoretical change model (Purnell et al., 2023). Additional theories that can be applied in research are Lippitt's phases of change theory change, developing a relationship between system and change agent, defining the problem, implementation, stabilization, and redefining the change agent system relationship (Purnell et al., 2023). Kotter's model focuses on the urgency for change, forming a team, vision, and stakeholders, removing barriers, and stabilizing change (Purnell et al., 2023).   





Beatrice:
In today's rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, the intersection of research, Big Data, and organizational change theories like Lewin's Change Theory, systems thinking, and implementation science are crucial for effective nursing practice and healthcare management (Favaretto et al., 2020). Analyzing informatics frameworks and models can provide valuable insights into improving patient care, optimizing organizational processes, and driving positive outcomes. 
Frameworks and Models
Firstly, considering the issues related to research and Big Data, it is evident that healthcare organizations are increasingly relying on data-driven insights to inform decision-making and enhance patient outcomes (Favaretto et al., 2020). Big Data offers vast opportunities to analyze large datasets, identify trends, and personalize patient care. However, challenges such as data security, interoperability, and ensuring data integrity remain pertinent. Leveraging informatics frameworks like the Health Information Exchange and the Continuity of Care Document can facilitate seamless data sharing across healthcare systems, ensuring continuity of care and promoting client safety. Big Data promises to revolutionize knowledge production within and beyond science by enabling novel, highly efficient ways to plan, conduct, disseminate, and assess research (Favaretto et al., 2020).
Secondly, Lewin's Change Theory, systems thinking, and implementation science are invaluable resources for healthcare organizations and nursing practice. Lewin's model emphasizes the importance of unfreezing existing behaviors, implementing change, and refreezing new behaviors to ensure sustainability (Wensing & Grol, 2019). This theory provides a structured approach to managing change within healthcare organizations, promoting a culture of innovation and continuous improvement. On the other hand, systems thinking encourages healthcare professionals to view healthcare organizations as interconnected systems, where changes in one area can impact the entire system. Implementation science offers evidence-based strategies for translating research findings into clinical practice, optimizing the adoption of new interventions, and improving patient outcomes (Wensing & Grol, 2019).
Telehealth and telemedicine models also have significant implications for informatics in nursing. These models leverage technology to provide patients with remote healthcare services, consultations, monitoring, and education. In nursing informatics, telehealth and telemedicine models impact various aspects of nursing practice and healthcare delivery (Velayati et al., 2022).
Health Information Systems Integration
Telehealth and telemedicine platforms often require integration with existing health information systems, such as electronic health records and clinical decision support systems. Nursing informatics professionals are crucial in ensuring seamless integration and interoperability between these systems to facilitate efficient data exchange and continuity of care (Velayati et al., 2022).
Teleconsultation and Collaboration
Telehealth and telemedicine models enable remote consultations and collaborations between healthcare providers, including nurses, physicians, specialists, and other interdisciplinary team members. Nursing informatics facilitates teleconsultation platforms, virtual care coordination tools, and secure messaging systems that support seamless communication and collaboration among healthcare clinicians, regardless of geographical location (Velayati et al., 2022). Moreover, these platforms necessitate addressing ethical and legal considerations associated with telehealth and telemedicine, such as privacy, security, informed consent, licensure, and liability. Informatics professionals ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, standards, and guidelines related to telehealth practice, data protection, and telecommunication technologies to safeguard patient confidentiality and mitigate legal risks.
Application in Outpatient Psychiatric Clinics
My practice integrates these models and frameworks into the workflow of outpatient psychiatric clinics. Leveraging frameworks such as Health Information Exchange and Continuity of Care Document can enhance data sharing and ensure continuity of care for psychiatric patients receiving treatment in outpatient settings. Additionally, implementing strategies from Lewin's Change Theory, systems thinking, and implementation science can promote innovation, improve patient outcomes, and foster a culture of continuous improvement within psychiatric nursing practice. Telehealth and telemedicine models further expand access to care and facilitate remote consultations and collaborations, which are particularly valuable in psychiatric care where multidisciplinary team communication is essential. By addressing ethical and legal considerations associated with telehealth and telemedicine, nursing informatics professionals can safeguard patient confidentiality and mitigate legal risks, ultimately enhancing the quality of care provided in outpatient psychiatric clinics.
Conclusion
Informatics frameworks and models are pivotal in guiding healthcare organizations and nursing practice towards delivering high-quality, patient-centered care. Nurses can navigate complex healthcare environments effectively, drive meaningful change, and improve client outcomes by leveraging principles and best practices from theories like Lewin's Change Theory, systems thinking, implementation science, and Telehealth/telemedicine models.





Precious:
Introduction
Nevertheless, modern healthcare is marked by a significant increase in big data, creating a conducive setting for nurse researchers to extract valuable insights. While the sheer volume of data appears attractive, some hidden problems must be solved responsibly. This section looks closely at the dilemmas of big data in research and the impact of implementing it in nursing practice. With Lewin's Change Theory, systems thinking, and implementation science as tools, together with exploring other theories, this discourse would highlight the significance of these frameworks when venturing through the healthcare landscape, which constantly changes.
Understanding Big Data in Healthcare Research
Big Data includes vast amounts of information collected from different sources, such as electronic health records, wearable devices, and social media platforms. The realization of this immense undertaking would open doors to the prospect of scientific discoveries and other obstacles. On the other hand, Big Data provides for a widespread and complex analysis of data, which can identify patterns and trends in a manner that most traditional research methods could not detect. However, the more difficult task of processing, analyzing, and making sense of large amounts of data creates obstacles that take time to overcome.
Implications for Implementation:
 Using big data technologies in research highlights the viewpoints that must be employed in evidence-based practice and healthcare improvement. However, specific barriers impede the translation of the research data into clinical action. Implementation gaps may happen for multiple reasons, such as organizational resistance, poor resources, and the parties' incompatible interests (Thompson, 2019). However, the quantity and speed of data can frighten healthcare workers and contribute to ineffective decision-making and action.
Lewin’s Change Theory and Systems Thinking
The Change Theory by Lewin will open new doors of knowledge on the interpretation and operation of organizational change. By highlighting the significance of changing current behaviors, introducing change, and creating new behaviors, this theory prepares nurse leaders to translate research outcomes into practice dynamically. The machine-like model of change with Lewin is balanced with systems thinking, on the other hand, by considering healthcare organizations as interdependent systems (Jonna, 2019). In addition to the systems' dependencies, the other essential point for further implementation challenges is to acknowledge the interdependencies of these systems. However, sustainable transformations would be the result of such efforts.
Implementation Science
Implementation science develops a logical movement from research to implementation by employing rigorous procedures. Combining the ideas from different academic treatments, including psychology, sociology, and organizational behavior, is believed to improve the advice efficacy rate (Sipes, 2020). The essential components of implementation science involve recognizing barriers and facilitators, designing interventions to fit the context, and implementing an implementation framework as the guide.
Additional Theories and Models
The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) delivers an entire array of influential and multilevel factors when considering an approach for enhancing implementation success. By focusing on domains, including intervention features, contextual inner and outer settings, intervention actors, and the implementation itself, CFIR provides a clear picture of how different factors perfectly mix to make the outcomes of the said process happen.
The Socio-Technical Systems (STS) Theory presents the view that the social aspect, separately from the engineering aspect, is not valid within organizations (Wensing & Grol, 2019). STS theory highlights that successful implementation mainly depends on technological innovations and the human factor within these processes; STS theory emphasizes the importance of aligning technical solutions with social dynamics and organizational culture.
Discussion
Informatics frameworks and models provide the necessary structure for healthcare organizations to optimize their use of technology and thoughtfully analyze data to make well-informed decisions. Various important models and models relate to this case, each with principles and practices that can contribute to practice.
The Nursing Informatics Competency Assessment (NICA) model is a widely used informatics framework utilized by healthcare organizations and during nursing practice. This model defines the knowledge reflecting the aptitude of the nurse, which they should apply in informatics practice. Some significant aspects of NICA include competency in information management, technology competency, and informatics integration in nursing care. Nurses can utilize this theory by evaluating their competencies through assessments to discover the areas for skill enhancement and training (American Nurses Association 2015). They can further improve their nursing care. Nurses can optimize workflows through information technology skills. This can be done in patient information documentation, communication, and decision-making. Thus, the quality of care can be improved.
One more key informatics framework is the Health Information Technology Adoption Model (HITAM), which is about the stages of technology adoption within medical care organizations. This model highlights that organizational readiness and leadership commitment are the key factors to successfully introducing technologies. Nurses have a meaningful role in encouraging the development of more HITAM in their facilities, which should enable the circumventing of complex technologies and focus on excellent patient safety (American Nurses Association 2015). Through active involvement in the introduction process and analyzing how nursing staff find technology implementation timely and helpful in their practice, nurses can ensure the new technology meets their therapeutic needs and improves their work rather than complicates it.
The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) emphasizes the factors contributing to technology acceptance. The adaptability of technological innovation is directly influenced by the two determinants, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, as per the TAM. Such an approach allows nurses to take a front seat to 'being creative,' they can drive the changes by partaking in user-centered design processes and advising for technologies that are easy to use, intuitive, and complementary to their clinical workflow. User involvement in selecting and customizing technology systems within healthcare organizations can enhance the suitability and implementation of such systems.
The Information Systems Continuum (ISC) model, in turn, is a tool for evaluating the level of information systems of medical organizations. This framework defines the phases through which the information systems progress, starting from basic automation and moving to advanced integration and data analysis technology. Nurses can advance the practice by strongly advocating for investment in information systems that facilitate smooth data exchange, interoperability, and real-time analytics. Using innovative data systems in nursing, nurses can take hold of current and accurate data, guide clinical decision-making, follow up on patient outcomes, and improve quality initiatives.
Informatics frameworks and models are helpful for health organizations and nursing practices that attempt to use technology and data for higher-quality care delivery. Nurses can use guidelines such as competency assessment, technology adaptation, user acceptance, and information system maturity to deliver quality patient care and improve healthcare informatics. The nurses can exploit the power of informatics through continuous learning, togetherness, and advocacy. This leads to the improvement of patients and the transformation of healthcare delivery.
Conclusion
Incorporating Big Data into healthcare research holds enormous potential for practice in nursing implementation. The availability of vast data attracts applications in evidence-based policy and quality management. However, gathering, analyzing, and applying the data and their interpretations in practice is complex. Using Lewin's Change Theory, systems thinking, and implementation science, along with CFIR and STS theories, among others, nurse leaders can successfully remove the gap between research and practice, resulting in better patient outcomes and advancement of the nursing field.



Bambi:
Transforming Nursing and Healthcare through Technology
             

The critical review of the available informatics frameworks and models applicable to healthcare organizations and nursing practice reveals various findings. First to the list is the Health Information Technology Evaluation Collaborative (HITEC) model, which offers a comprehensive review approach against whatever is delivered within the Health Information Technologies (HIT) evaluation. HITEC underscores that the assessment of the HIT solution is built around areas that the impact lies in, such as patient safety, quality of care, and efficiency within the healthcare environment (Esdar, 2022). This framework has emphasized itself as a clear, transparent way nursing practitioners will use in the assessment of HIT solutions in a bid to ensure that adopted technologies closely relate to revealed objectives of improving welfare and operational efficiency. Therefore, the new HITEC framework has empowered nurses to make decisions about informed HIT adoption, implementation, and strategies for its optimization.
The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was combined with the HITEC framework to shed some light on adopting health professional technology. The latter implied that two things are important in molding a person's attitude toward technology adoption: perceived usefulness and ease of use. The TAM provides a structured framework to consider the feasibility of an acceptance solution by nursing practitioners towards informatics to appreciate whether new technologies represent models of work processes and objectives in the care of such patients (Jacob, Sanchez-Vazquez, & Ivory, 2020). It will offer the nursing profession and the individual nurse an opportunity to spot any resistance challenges, reassure the users, and instigate effective implementation strategies so that these can be heightened for integrating informatics solutions in nursing practice.
Another view on the Nursing Informatics Competency Assessment (NICA) model is that it provides a systematic way to diagnose and refine nursing informatics competencies (Jacob, Sanchez-Vazquez, & Ivory, 2020). That is meant to define the skills in life and knowledge in areas that would help transfer the nurse to effectively use informatics tools in practice, among them data management and the use of information, and inspire technology adoption. The application of the NICA framework would help a nurse to become adequately competent in the proper use of technology toward different aspects of delivery, documentation, and communication with patients, and all these technological uses would regularly be kept updated with the use. This would also ensure that effective informatics practices in nursing fit could be available and ready to apply in the ever-changing healthcare environment.
Indeed, user-based design principles can find embodiment in the fullest measure for the whole nursing profession in the embracement of the Frameworks of Informatics when the decisions have to be made concerning the selection and designing of the Informatics solutions that they have to work with. Indeed, when these technologies selected and evaluated in clinical settings operate parallel to specific needs and work-process preferences by the clinical team members, for instance, if the nurses and other healthcare team members are well-engaged, then this happens because the same end-users have been involved to a greater extent in the planning and the evaluation steps (Ackerhans et al., 2024). Such an approach guarantees far higher levels of acceptance and buy-in by the users that drive the successful adoption of an informatics solution and its culmination for use within nursing practice. Further, using frameworks like HITEC enables nursing professionals to assess and monitor the informatics initiative toward how technology has affected patient safety, quality of care, and operating efficiency.
In conclusion, practice can be guided, and a way of thinking can be structured toward the complex resources represented in healthcare technologies by applying informatics frameworks and models. From that perspective, only nursing professionals will be best placed to achieve this improvement by applying the principles and best practices outlined in the frameworks. Most importantly, these informatics frameworks provide operational services for better care delivery to the patient, easy communication, and teamwork among healthcare teams about improved patient outcomes. With the incorporation of insights from informatics frameworks into nursing practice, nursing professionals will be at the command post in keeping themselves informed with the latest technological advances and correcting the culture of innovations, thus ensuring continuous technology improvement in caring for patients.",Nursing,Nursing|Discussion,https://www.sweetstudy.com/questions/discussion-replies-to-colleagues

Assessment Description

Students have multiple factors that affect their knowledge acquisition, growth, and success in a classroom, including their native language, culture, and socioeconomic status. It is important for educators to assess and reflect upon these factors to help eliminate bias and determine the best classroom instructional practices when working with students.   
        
Create a resource for educators describing the role language, culture, and socioeconomic status plays in child development. Choose one of the following deliverables to complete this assignment:

· 12-15 slide digital presentation, including presenter’s notes with documentation of resources and a title slide
· 3-5 minute video, include documentation of resources in a document along with the video link
Utilizing the deliverable choice, present the following information to other educators:
· Unique aspects of elementary students’ language development and how language acquisition affects other areas of their development, including cognitive and social-emotional.
· Explanation of how culture affects the development and learning of children and early adolescents.
· Explanation of how socioeconomic status, including poverty, affects the development and learning of children and early adolescents. Include at least one suggestion for supporting students facing economic disparities.
· Describe how language acquisition, culture, and socioeconomic status of a student affects classroom practices. Include a discussion of how a teacher can work to eliminate potential bias that may arise in the classroom related to language, culture, and socioeconomic status, both their own bias and others.
· Provide 2-3 ways teachers can support diverse languages and cultures in the classroom to further promote student learning and development.
· Provide 2-3 local or global learning networks teachers could research or actively participate in to learn more about supporting students with factors that limit their success in the classroom.

Social Science - Sociology Assignment,Please see attachment,Researcherscanemployaquantitativeorqualitativeapproac.pdf|WKS2.docx|WKS3.docx,Researcherscanemployaquantitativeorqualitativeapproac.pdf,"Researchers can employ a quantitative or qualitative approach, or a combination of the 
two. In quantitative studies, you often see tables of numerical data or graphs in the Results 
section. Qualitative studies, on the other hand, use interviews, focus groups, and 
observations to understand the participants’ perceptions. Rather than using statistics to 
summarize the study, these studies look at themes and present the material in words, 
phrases, and often paragraphs. Here you might see portions of transcribed interviews in 
the Results section. A mixed-methods approach, as the name implies, uses both 
quantitative and qualitative methods to answer the research questions. It is important to 
understand the methodological approach in any given article so that you may evaluate 
whether the research study was conducted appropriately. 

In this Assignment, you return to your six peer-reviewed research articles, select two, and 
identify the research question and the associated methodological approach in each. 

 TO PREPARE 

Review the Learning Resources on research methodologies, including the interactive 
media on quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods. 

Revisit the six peer-reviewed articles you gathered on your topic in Weeks 2 and 3. 
Consider the research question and methodology the researchers have employed in each 
study. 

Focus on two of the articles for this Assignment. 

Note that in future weeks you will continue to work with the other articles as well, so do not 
discard them.

4.1:     Background Information Doug Wilson ( | Accounting," 


Background Information
Doug Wilson (2017) shares that he now reads with intentionality. The aim of his approach is “to practice the skill of learning metaphorically and thereby cultivate [his] imagination” (Wilson, p. 70). He goes on to share that his orientation to reading is credited to a “spiritual, business, and overall life mentor . . . [who] continually handed [him] short stories, saying ‘READ THIS’ and followed up with four questions” (Wilson, p. 70). Those four “Literary Executive” questions follow:

What did you learn?
How did you discover that?
Why is that important?
So what? (Wilson, p. 70)

While the questions may seem simplistic and easy to answer, a key piece of information not found in Wilson’s (2017) article—at least not in any detail—is that one of those questions can be quite difficult to address if critical reflection goes beyond the obvious.  
With the spotlight on the VBM’s “professional” domain in the virtuous leader domain, critically reflect on the article reading for this exercise using the four “Literary Executive” questions:

What did you learn?
How did you discover that?
Why is it important?
So what?

Psychology has both applied and basic aspects to its research. Not all research is important; some studies are fascinating, add to our knowledge of an area, and their findings surprise us, but may have no immediate application. Other studies are clearly important, but may not be of any particular interest to the public or even the researcher. Drug research might be an example - very important, but not necessarily something most people want to read about in a journal. Is your study both interesting and important? If so, how? If not, which one is it, and why? If it isn't either, why did you chose and stick with your topic?
